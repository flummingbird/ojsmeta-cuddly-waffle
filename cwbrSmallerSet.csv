1121|\N|\N|REDISCOVERING CIVIL WAR CLASSICS:<br> Lincoln Under Enemy Fire|\N|Madden, David|\N|\N|"<h3>Lincoln Under Enemy Fire</h3><br><p><i>Lincoln Under Enemy Fire</i> (1948) by John H. Cramer</p><p>Before he came under the direct, surprise enemy fire of the failed actor John Wilkes Booth while watching the comedy Our American Cousin in Ford's Theater on the evening of April 14, 1865, the Great Emancipator knowingly exposed himself to enemy sharpshooters nine months earlier on the afternoon of July 12, 1864, so that he could witness the national drama of our Civil War at Fort Stevens on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., during Confederate General Jubal Early's daring, desperate assault on the Capitol. </p><p>The most popular account of the commander-in-chief under enemy fire at Fort Stevens is the one that involves The Yankee from Olympus, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Colonel Holmes was assigned the duty of showing the President the defenses around Washington. When the six-foot-four Lincoln, his height increased by his tall plug hat, exposed himself and bullets began to fly, Colonel Holmes yelled, Get down, you fool! Later, in the act of leaving, Lincoln walked back to say, Good-bye Colonel Holmes. I'm glad you know how to talk to a civilian.</p><p>Lincoln biographers and Civil War historians do not make much of this incident, when they mention it at all. John H. Cramer made very much of it, indeed, in his 1948 book <i>Lincoln Under Fire: The Complete Account of His Experiences During Early's Attack on Washington</i>  And complete it is, being Cramer's gathering of many testimonials in letters, journals, and memoirs, published and unpublished up to 1948. </p><p>All recorded witnesses agree that Lincoln was there, along with his wife, the Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, and a somewhat foolhardy crowd of Washingtonians and that he was either fired upon as a tall, exposed figure in a stove hat or that the actual target was the military doctor who stood beside him and who fell wounded.</p><p>The witnesses, who include soldiers, officers, and members of Lincoln's high-placed entourage, among others, differ among themselves only on relatively minor details. Historians seem to mistrust not only Holmes's account but also that of one or two less famous witnesses. Lucius E. Chittenden, register of the treasury, recalled that a young colonel of artillery was severely worried that the President had ignored his declarations of concern for his safety. He finally got up enough courage to say, Mr. President, you are standing within range of five hundred rebel rifles. Please come down to a safer place. If you do not, it will be my duty to call a file of men and make you.  The President responded: And you would be quite right, my boy! . . . You are in command of this fort. I should be the last man to set an example of disobedience (51). Elizabeth Thomas, an elderly African American, looked out the window of her basement nearby and saw Lincoln standing tall on the bank of the trenches and yelled to men near him, My God, make that fool get off that hill and come in here! She remembered later that the President only smiled (57).</p>    <p>Those images of President Abraham Lincoln exposing himself to enemy fire, told to cease and desist for his own good and thus for the good of the country, are the stuff of folklore, and sure enough B. A. Botkin quotes not Holmes but Chittenden, devoting also many pages to other Lincoln lore in his book <i>A Civil War Treasury of Tales, Legends, and Folklore</i> (1960). And it was a newsworthy event, though not nearly an item of importance commensurate with its effect on the outcome of the war, given the severe consequences had sharpshooters hit their target in the theater of war before Booth's aim was true in the theater of pretense. That consideration ought to have been enough to move more historians to make much of it. </p><p>One witness observed that never before had a president, the commander-in-chief, exposed himself to enemy fire. But several incidents do somewhat parallel that of Lincoln. General Lee exposed himself at Seminary Ridge just before Pickett's charge at Gettysburg. From three thousand lips at once burst the cry, <i>General Lee to the rear' </i>-- and not a foot would stir until he was led back through a gap in the line. General Stonewall Jackson, riding recon at twilight with a few officers May 2, 1863, in a confused wilderness setting at Chancellorsville, was wounded by his own men, and died a few days later.  General Nathan Bedford Forrest, The Wizard of the Saddle, leading his Critter Company against Sherman's cavalry on the road to Corinth a few days after the battle of Shiloh in July 1862, charged ahead of his men, Union soldiers surrounded him, hundreds of rifles fired upon him, one shot got him in the hip, another hit his horse, but he shot his way back to his own men. The iconic image of reckless exposure to enemy fire is Winslow Homer's famous painting of a Confederate private Inviting a Shot Before Petersburg, Virginia, 1864, daring the Union Troops to shoot him. </p><p>Given David Donald's importance as a major Lincoln biographer, his 1948 review of Cramer's book is a good argument for rediscovering this Roshamon study of a so-called minor event. With astonishing thoroughness Mr. Cramer has tracked down about twenty-five firsthand versions (and some fifteen secondary interpretations of those accounts) of what actually happened to Lincoln at Fort Stevens. The tales are confused and diverse?. <i>Lincoln under Enemy Fire</i> deals with what its author modestly terms an interesting but unimportant\ episode of the President's career. But if it is no major revelation of Lincoln, it tells much about Lincoln biographers, their sources, and their methods. This little book is, in fact, a case study in historical evidence, and Mr. Cramer handles his material with an honesty and a lack of pretentiousness that any scholar might envy.</p><p>Having satisfied his fervent desire to gather all the facts as conveyed by eyewitnesses, Cramer apparently was not moved to delineate some of the implications of that extraordinary event. Nor have historians, having read Cramer's research, been so moved.</p><p>Consider first that this is a supreme example of faulty human perception, the theme that inspired Ambrose Bierce's short stories <i>In the Midst of Life </i>(1891). The vision of men and women under fire that day had to be affected by fearsome excitement, raising questions such as: </p><p>Who fired upon the exposed figure, sharpshooters or line soldiers?</p><p>Who did they think they saw, the enemy President or a tall, more-foolish-than-most civilian among the crowd of spectators?</p><p>Did a sharpshooter recognize him as the President of the United States of America and spare him out of a transcendent sort of respect and admiration or even fear?If a sharpshooter recognized him as President Lincoln, did he correct his vision on the assumption that the president would never conduct himself in such a foolhardy way?</p><p>Were they shooting at the tall man in civilian clothes or at the man in uniform standing by him?</p><p>Did Lincoln realize how exposed he stood?</p><p>What was Lincoln's mood that day?</p><p>Was there something in his mind that led him consciously or unconsciously to expose himself and the fate of the nation to enemy fire?</p><p>Was he trying to prove his courage to his wife, to military and civilian folks under his command as commander-in-chief?</p>	<p>Would we do well to subject each episode of the war to this sort of imaginative interrogation? For example, to learn what happened in the attack upon the crater at Petersburg we go to the historian of the hour, the one we expect to trust as the authority who has reviewed past research recorded in books by previous historians with, we hope, the addition of newly revealed information. But if we read six or so accounts by six historians we may very well feel, as Cramer did when he examined eyewitness testimonials, that we are reading about six different battles (I have done that exercise myself). We would do well, I think, to imagine the possible implications?a role well suited to readers who do not feel the restraints historians perhaps need to feel. </p><p>As we stand at the window in view of the Sesquicentennial of the Civil War, I propose that as we consult the 128 volumes of the <i>War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies</i> and other eyewitness documents and the work of historians derived from them, we let this striking Lincoln example serve as a metaphor for the general unreliability or at least incompleteness of statements held up as factual and as an invitation to allow our emotions, imaginations, and intellects to come fully into play.</p><p><i>Founding Director of the United States Civil War Center and creator of</i> Civil War Book Review<i>, David Madden is Robert Penn Warren Professor of English at Louisiana State University.

1123|\N|\N|EDITORIAL:<br>How Historians Remember the Civil War|\N|Childers, Christopher|\N|\N|<b>How Historians Remember the Civil War </b><p><br>Many people tend to view Civil War commemoration as an almost strictly public act where individuals, civic organizations, veterans groups, heritage societies, and others participate in celebrations and ceremonies to remember the over 600,000 Union and Confederate soldiers who lost their lives fighting one another on American soil.  While statues, flags, and monuments stand as public markers of history and identity, historians and students of the Civil War have amassed a monumental corpus of printed material written to tell the history of the Civil War.  Indeed, the writing of history serves as yet another form of commemoration.  And like the more familiar public displays and ceremonies mentioned above, written histories generate controversy.  The reviewers who contribute to <i>Civil War Book Review</i> participate in the process of debating just how to faithfully and correctly remember, record, preserve, and?perhaps even?commemorate, the story of America's Civil War.</p><p>Robert J. Cook revisits the tumultuous American Civil War centennial and recounts how competing notions of race, memory, heritage, and commemoration intersected and clashed in the early 1960s as the United States Civil War Centennial Commission sought to plan the centennial activities.  Cook's book, <i>Troubled Commemoration: The American Civil War Centennial, 1961-1965</i> serves as a timely reminder that as we approach the sesquicentennial of the Civil War in 2011-2015, the nation will no doubt wrestle with these issues once more.</p><p>Of course, the writing of Civil War history proceeds at its usual brisk pace.  In this issue of <i>CWBR</i>, readers will find a full complement of the diverse studies offered by students of the war.  Several recent works have focused closely on the beliefs and experiences of Civil War soldiers.  In <i>The View from the Ground: Experiences of Civil War Soldiers</i>, editor Aaron Sheehan-Dean presents a wide complement of essays that analyze aspects of soldier life and labor from both the Union and Confederate perspective.  More specifically, Chandra Manning's <i>What This Cruel War Was Over: Soldiers, Slavery, and the Civil War</i> argues forcefully that soldiers saw the war as a fight over slavery.  Randall M. Miller reviews this important new work in this issue.  Additionally, the <i>CWBR</i> Author Interview features Professor Manning discussing her new book.</p><p>Community studies remain an important component of Civil War studies.  Over twenty years ago, Suzanne Lebsock wrote her study of the women of Petersburg, Virginia, and how they lived before and during the Civil War.  A. Wilson Greene adds another layer to the Petersburg story with his <i>Civil War Petersburg: Confederate City in the Crucible of War</i> by analyzing the strategic importance of the city as well as its internal dynamics. Wayne Wei-siang Hsieh reviews this book.  And as Gordon B. McKinney points out in his review of <i>Lincolnites and Rebels: A Divided Town in the American Civil War</i>, historian Robert Tracy McKenzie has fundamentally altered the traditional interpretation of the sharply divided Knoxville, Tennessee by chronicling a civil war within the Civil War.</p><p>With the bicentennial of Abraham Lincoln's birth approaching, scholarly interest in Lincoln's life and political career?which has never suffered for attention?is gaining added momentum.  David Madden rediscovers <i>Lincoln Under Enemy Fire</i>, a classic account of the commander-in-chief's April 1864 visit to Fort Stevens during Confederate General Jubal Early's attack on Washington, D.C.  </p><p>Leah Wood Jewett's latest column captures the essence of planter John Elder's diary during the Battle of Baton Rouge.  Faced with the chaos of warfare at home, Elder's records the everyday way of life while under fire in his usually terse entries, which leave the reader wondering how and why Mr. Elder remained so calm and matter-of-fact on paper?and if his composure held strictly on paper.</p><p>Enjoy studying?and commemorating?the Civil War.</p>|\N|Summer 2007|8/1/2007|Editorial|\N|\N|\N|\N|Front_Center|\N|\N|"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=61 alt=\Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/cwbrdefault.jpg\"">"""|\N

1422|195120620|\N|Jefferson Davis's Generals|Jefferson Davis's Generals|Boritt, Gabor S.|\N|\N|"The eight essays included in <B>Jefferson Davis's Generals</B> stem from papers written by various authors and presented to the editor's Civil War Institute at Gettysburg. Five of the papers discuss relations between commander in chief Davis and some of his full generals: J.E. Johnston, R.E. Lee, Beauregard, Bragg, and Hood; one deals with the wives of all these except Hood; another concerns pictures of Davis in the Northern press; and the last addresses broad questions of strategy and history. Although each essay is followed by endnotes and a bibliographic essay, there is no index for the collection.<p>Craig L. Symonds's essay treats coolly the hot topic of his subtitle's double entendre: \Davis and Johnston at War.\"" The two men, so much alike, clashed repeatedly until Davis finally wrote out for Congress, but never sent, his explanation of why he could not again give Johnston charge of an army. In a balanced, careful assessment, Symonds awards the palm for valor in this \""war\"" to Davis, but perhaps overstates the case in calling this \""dysfunctional partnership\"" a major cause of defeat.<p>In Emory M. Thomas's paper, Thomas states that the Confederate president, and historians after him, \""believed that Lee and Davis were in strategic accord when, in fact, they were not.\"" Davis wanted defense while Lee wanted \""climactic battle.\"" Conceding that \""Lee never spoke or wrote his heresy,\"" Thomas seeks proof in Lee's two invasions of the North. But he fails to note that Davis approved both campaigns, and that it was Beauregard, not Davis, who refused to supply the diversion Lee wanted in 1863 (and for good reasons: insufficient troops and an impending attack on Charleston).<p>T. Michl Parrish's contribution to <B>Jefferson Davis's Generals</B> points out that Beauregard thought up grand strategies that President Davis never adopted -- one cause of the friction between the two men. Parrish treats their \""animus\"" evenhandedly, pointing out that Davis put the general in the right niche at Charleston and that the two were able to smother their feelings for the good of the Cause they both loved. Parrish's crystal clear style helps to make this essay a gem.<p>Steven E. Woodworth's essay blames Davis for, of all things, not supporting Braxton Bragg -- failing to provide \""a sound command system along with good officers.\"" Whether or not this makes Davis liable for Bragg's failures, we at least learn that the two were not special friends. Some assertions in this essay seem dubious, but reading that Bragg was a good general with \""genuine talent\"" whose subordinates did indeed sometimes fail him is a refreshing change.<p>Herman Hattaway's paper expertly discusses many aspects of John Bell Hood's rise to a top command and his friendship of mutual admiration with Davis. Mostly Hattaway is right on target, showing that Hood deserved promotions for his battlefield performance but did not know how to manage an entire army. Hattaway dismisses the idea that Hood was a \""spy\"" for Davis. The essay seems to accept, however, the widespread but erroneous notion that Davis approved Hood's fatal move to Nashville.<p>In a happy shift of gaze to women, <B>Jefferson Davis's Generals</B> presents an essay by Lesley J. Gordon. Gordon shows Varina Davis, Lydia Johnston, and Elise Bragg with devoted husbands, in contrast to Caroline Beauregard, whose husband neglected her. Greater acquaintance with the Lees' circumstances might have sweetened the author's view of Robert and Mary. The other portraits in Gordon's contribution, except for a few errors, are well done and true to life.<p>Harold Holzer's piece uses illustrations to trace the printed image of Davis in the Northern press, from military president to traitor to buffoon, and then later -- in an \""iconographic miracle\"" -- to restored hero. Davis never wore the Confederate uniform that some prints put on him, Holzer says, but he was always \""the living symbol\"" of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause.<p>James M. McPherson's work gives a brilliant analysis of strategy, puts the War in the broad context of history, and then takes up particular points, even clearing muddy ones presented in the book's other essays. In the face of Southern soul-searching, he ends on a novel note: maybe the Yankee army had something to do with the Confederate defeat.<p>With its varied topics, viewpoints, and styles, this collection of essays will interest scholar and non-scholar alike.<p><I>Felicity Allen lives in Auburn, Alabama.

Willcox|Scott, Robert Garth|\N|\N|"While Robert Garth Scott's claim that this is \the largest collection of Civil War papers to surface in half a century\"" may be true, what is certain is that <B>Forgotten Valor</B> is one of the most complete, candid, and compelling memoirs to cover the professional military career of an unsung but stalwart war hero. Orlando Boliver Willcox (1823-1907) served for 44 years in the U.S. Army, most notably as a brevet major general during the Civil War.<p>This massive collection of previously unpublished papers chronicles the military life of an officer who kept meticulous journals, diaries, letters, and copies of his official reports throughout his career. Scott has gathered these sources and produced a stunningly refreshing memoir of an articulate and perceptive man whose writings reveal his military skills, leadership ability, insight, and rather direct sense of humor.<p>After graduating from West Point in 1843, Willcox served in Mexico with Winfield Scott, chased the Plains Indians in Kansas, and pursued the Seminoles in Florida. Army life in those years was dangerous, lonely, and frustrating, with Willcox observing that \""good liquor and good morals are equally scarce.\"" Although this memoir covers nearly five decades of army service, most of the work is related to Willcox's Civil War years. In 1861, at the outbreak of the War, this Detroit native was appointed colonel of the 1st Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He fought at Manassas, in \""one of the best planned but worst fought battles of the Civil War.\"" Willcox was captured there and later received the Medal of Honor for his bravery on that battlefield.<p>Quickly recognized as a courageous and capable leader, Willcox was rapidly promoted upon his release from a Confederate prison, serving as either a division commander or as commanding general of the Union army's IX Corps for the rest of the War. He and his soldiers fought gallantly at South Mountain, Antietam, Fredericksburg, the Wilderness, Cold Harbor, and Petersburg. While on temporary duty, Willcox also pursued the raider John Hunt Moran in Indiana and fought rebel guerrillas in eastern Tennessee.<p>His descriptions of army life on campaign, in camp, and in battles are vivid and frank. Even a major general complains about slow mail service, infrequent paycalls, and meddling politicians. Willcox is especially wary of \""the heroes of the quill,\"" those moralists, journalists, and critics who have never smelled gunpowder or been acquainted with rebel artillery.<p>His remembrances of fellow officers are honest and unvarnished, and particularly interesting are his comments about General Ulysses S. Grant. Willcox is also no stranger to controversy and his thoughts on personal and professional difficulties are bracing and fresh. His sense of humor is best revealed in his \""treatise on modern war,\"" which is a skewering spoof of military bureaucracy, red-tape, and single-mindedness.<p>Lengthy, detailed, and heavily footnoted for reference and clarity, <B>Forgotten Valor</B> offers a well-crafted look at an intrepid warrior who devoted his life to the army and his heart to his troops.<p><I>William D.

To make explicit its lessons, somehow to make them useful and instructive, and possibly influential, is more difficult, and perhaps more dangerous.<p>Harry Crocker's book is subtitled <I>Executive Lessons in Character, Courage, and Vision.</I> Early on, it states its purpose as \a book for businessmen -- the vocation that most Americans are called to perform -- seeking guidance on how to lead a business, employees, subordinates. But it is also a book for the whole man.\"" In other words, <B>Lee on Leadership</B> aims to identify what it was in this \""most perfect man\"" that made him successful as a leader. Can we learn and apply such lessons?<p>Matthew Arnold called Marcus Aurelius the most perfect man in history. In our own time, among men of affairs, we say that George Marshall was a perfect embodiment of devoted public service. But all such men, near-demigods to some, succeed less by what they do than by what they are; and history is embarrassed when it tries to communicate that \""are\"" -- their character.<p>Nonetheless, Crocker identifies a number of qualities in Lee that would seem useful to all who would lead. His method is chronological: a series of chapters that follow Lee from adolescence to early old age, that cross familiar ground, but in new ways, and in ways that remind us that nobility of character, self-discipline, and forbearance, unaccompanied by a practiced ability to get things done, is not very useful in war.<p>Each chapter ends with the lessons enumerated, such as \""A leader remembers that the goal of leadership is not self-fulfillment but service to his fellow men.\""<p>And the leader, if he emulates Lee (emulation plays but a small role in any scheme of education in the America of 1999), will lose himself in the work, will be \""careless\"" of self and nobly humble, eschewing self-advertising.<p>This strange, hybrid book -- part historical, part biographical, and part handbook -- is beautiful in its concision and austerity. The author wears his philosophy and his knowledge of Lee, and of the theaters in which Lee worked, easily.<p>The tone is elegiac, as if Crocker understands, as most of us do, that it is impossible that such a man should appear again -- and that the qualities and techniques of leadership that infused his character can but serve as reminders and guides to the frailer clay that now presumes to lead -- to lead <I>anything</I> -- in our country.<p><I>Josiah Bunting III serves as superintendent and professor of the humanities at Virginia Military Institute.</I>"""|Bunting III, Josiah|Fall 1999|9/1/1999|Review|What General Robert E.

Pullen's portrait is lacking in objectivity or is in any way approaching hagiography, for he is most careful in distinguishing between facts and the nimbus of mythology, which lately by fiction and film has enhanced the image of Joshua Chamberlain. No. The author points out that the mythic element rests on a firm foundation of fact that has been a catalyst to the mythic aura and that mythology itself is not to be despised as a motivator of noble behavior.<p>The bayonet charge at Little Roundtop at Gettysburg, which was so crucial in that battle, was not the only act of heroism in Chamberlain's life, as Pullen amply demonstrates. Yet in a sense it defined his character, initiated his fame, and echoed in the background of a long life with many trials. The primary focus of the book is upon Chamberlain's career after the Civil War -- and that was, at least in its early stages, a political career.<p>Pullen shows why Chamberlain was not cut out to be a successful politician. He was a man of principle, uncompromising in his values, and therefore it is not surprising that he made enemies. When faced with a choice -- between the general good and humane behavior, or party loyalty and political expediency that might further his own self-interest -- he always chose the noble path.<p>He was four times elected governor of Maine as a Republican, but as Pullen calls him, a \reluctant Republican.\"" The Republican Party leader, James G. Blaine, and the Radical Republicans in control of Congress in the Reconstruction years wished to reduce the Southern states to the status of territories. Chamberlain declined to follow the party line. At Appomattox he had gallantly offered an arms salute of his men to the surrendering Confederate officers. He opposed legislation that would, in effect, bar responsible white Southerners from any public post of leadership, and he opposed the unconstitutional infringements on President Andrew Johnson's powers. He resisted the extreme Prohibitionists in his party and enforced a court verdict of capital punishment for a cruel and brutal double murder by a black man. The result of taking these unpopular stands was political eclipse.<p>But his career of service to the people of Maine was not over. He initiated forward-looking reforms in education as president of Bowdoin College, saved Maine from threatened civil war over an election controversy as adjutant general, and faithfully carried out his duties in the humble office of surveyor of customs in Portland in his declining years. Despite decades of obscurity immediately following his death in 1914, of late his fame has revived through books and film and wide public recognition.

1509|805061479|\N|A Prayer for the Dying: A Novel|Prayer for the Dying: A Novel A|O'Nan, Stewart|\N|\N|With <B>A Prayer for the Dying</B>, Stewart O'Nan, author of five previous books, lives up to his billing in the literary magazine <I>Granta</I> as one of the best young American novelists. Known for his versatility, depth, and originality, O'Nan ventures into the nineteenth century for the first time and uses the second person to narrate a tale of one man's struggle to save his town from a pestilence of biblical proportions.<p>Set six years after the War ends, <B>A Prayer for the Dying</B> is not a conventional Civil War or Reconstruction novel; rather, it is a Civil War novel in the sense that <I>The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</I> is a World War II movie-in both stories wartime experiences fundamentally alter a veteran's outlook on life. The main character of the book is Jacob Hansen, who pulls triple-duty as the sheriff, undertaker, and pastor of Friendship, Wisconsin. As such, he has taken on the responsibility of counseling the townspeople from the pulpit, scolding and punishing them when they stray and preparing their bodies when they die. All the while, he is haunted by memories of the War.<p>Indeed, the War invades every facet of Hansen's life, influencing everything from how he trims his beard (he follows the fashion of his regiment's captain) to what transportation he takes (he feels compelled to use bicycles and railway handcars for transportation because the gruesome wartime experience of taking shelter inside the carcass of his horse to survive a Rebel siege has produced an inescapable repugnance for horses).<p>In the first chapter, O'Nan masterfully uses Hansen's trip to investigate a report of a dead man on a farmer's property and the thoughts running through Hansen's mind to introduce the town and the cast of characters, while foreshadowing all that is yet to come. When the doctor concludes that diphtheria caused the man's death, Hansen places his responsibility to the town above all else. Even though the disease spreads rapidly, he hesitates to implement a full quarantine and convinces his wife to remain, rather than flee to a safe distance with their newborn daughter, because he does not want to induce a panic. As the death toll rises and an unstoppable wildfire looms in the distance, the pressure on Hansen builds to a level both mentally and emotionally unbearable, leading to a final staggering revelation.<p><B>A Prayer for the Dying</B> is a Midwestern gothic that unmercifully explores how much emotional pain and suffering one man can endure, and, if he survives, the cost to his sanity and his faith. In short, Stewart O'Nan has combined the depth of Camus and Faulkner with the pure readability of Stephen King to produce an exceedingly literate and satisfying page-turner all his own.<p><I>Thomas Hill received an M.A. in history from Oklahoma State University and is currently working toward an M.F.A. in writing at the University of Memphis.</I>|Hill, Thomas|Fall 1999|9/1/1999|Review|A gothic depiction of one veteran's elusive peace|The unquiet memory|Henry Holt|0000-00-00|Fiction|\N|\N|\N|\N

In perfect parallel, the handsome illustrations provided by the highly published artist, Spellman, lend balance to Clayton's text.<p>The combination of art and history works so well that young readers initially interested in the text will be encouraged to pick up their pencils and sketch, while young artists initially interested in the artwork likely will be encouraged to put down their pencils and read. <B>Draw History</B> offers a useful tool for educators who wish to integrate art and history lessons into a cross-curriculum program.<p>The book is divided into six sections; each offers clear instructions for drawing figures and objects associated with the Civil War and includes lucid histories of the items.<p>For example, in the \Transportation\"" section, the steps for drawing Robert E. Lee's favorite horse, Traveller, are coupled with stories such as the day the horse saved Lee's life. Clayton writes: \""After the war, General Lee wrote a special description of Traveller for an artist who wanted to paint [Lee with his horse], saying, If I were an artist like you, I would draw Traveller with fine proportions and quick eye to describe his endurance of the dangers through which he passed.'\"" Keeping those words in mind and studying Spellman's instructions, a young artist could reproduce such a horse with \""fine proportions and quick eye.\""<p>The first section of the book, titled \""Buildings and Places,\"" requires nothing more than a ruler to complete drawings of typical buildings, bridges, and towers. In particular, the pages devoted to the famous Beanpole Bridge will surely interest readers.<p>The remaining five sections seem to lean on the premise that someone who can draw an oval, square, and triangle can draw anything. These sections are titled: \""The Big Guns,\"" \""Transportation,\"" \""War on the Water,\"" \""People,\"" and \""An Animal.\"" Included are subjects such as: the battlefield cannon, the Napoleon; Lincoln's funeral train engine, the Nashville; the \""Ghost Ship\"" <I>Alabama</I>; various soldiers, sailors, and officers of the Union and Confederacy; and Sallie, the courageous mascot of the 11th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment.

During that time Vinnie confides her concern about her family's worrisome finances, her feelings of adoration for newly inaugurated President Lincoln, her confusion over her brother's sympathy toward the Confederacy, and her own mixed feelings toward two potential suitors. Vinnie's letters detail the family's move to Washington, D.C., as well as the everyday pace of their lives during the War years.<p>Sappy's epistolary novel perfectly captures the tone of many Civil War correspondents: the overwrought phrasings, the sentimental tone, and the detailed narration. For example, when Vinnie learns of Regina's fianc's death at Castle Thunder prisoner of war camp, she writes: \This is the most difficult letter I have ever written, for each word is torn from my heart. If I could hide the truth from you, I would -- but I cannot. Dear friend, your beloved Edward died early yesterday morning.\""<p>Living in Washington, Vinnie has an insider's view of the War. Vinnie is an observer, not a player, however, and in order to bring her in contact with the events of the times, Sappy relies too much on coincidence. For example, Vinnie's sister goes on a date -- a picnic at Manassas on July 21, 1861. In another case, Vinnie and her mother enjoy an intimate tea -- an outing perfectly timed to coincide with the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation. On another occasion, Vinnie attends Lincoln's second inauguration -- the receiving line parts, and Frederick Douglass appears, thus allowing Vinnie to introduce yet another historical figure in her narrative.<p>What the book offers is a readable, personal history of the War, including observations about its horrors (Vinnie visits hospitals) and its intrigues (she discusses McClellan's political aspirations and military failures). But history, even when well told, does not a novel make. What is lacking technically is strong characterization to move the episodic plot. Vinnie, who after the war sculpts the statue of Lincoln now in the rotunda of the Capitol, tells what she does but reveals little about the internal motives that drive her. For example, she dispassionately writes of her growing interest in sculpting, \""I haven't told you before because I didn't want you to think me a braggart, but I have already completed several busts of prominent Washingtonians.\"" Such reporting distances readers from Vinnie, who must ultimately carry the novel -- not as a character who witnesses many things, but as one who is herself worth knowing.<p><I>Betty Carter is a professor of children's and young adult literature in the School of Library and Information Studies at Texas Woman's University in Denton, Texas.</I>"""|Carter, Betty|Fall 1999|9/1/1999|Review|War through the eyes of Lincoln's sculptress|Courageous dreamer|Front Street|0000-00-00|For_Kids|\N|\N|\N|\N

Designed for children 9-14 years old, the book is organized into six chapters followed by a short index. Catherine Clinton presents the War through human interest pieces, historic illustrations, and photographs, giving young readers a sensitive interpretation of this history.<p>Clinton attempts to explain the many ways this tragic war affected the people living in the North, South, West, and in slavery. Among the political events, social histories, and battle descriptions are relevant biographies, eyewitness accounts, famous and infamous letters, and journal entries.<p>The book's thoughtful cover design is indicative of the approach to the material inside. Young scholars may find it impossible to resist reading the unique entries that make this resource an up-to-date interpretation of the Civil War. Clinton has included articles that are surprising (for example, pets in army camps) and others that are emotional (such as the story of a nine-year-old drummer boy). This approach to presenting history may bring today's children closer to understanding the actions and fate of Americans during the Civil War.<p>Although Clinton has packed her volume with a diverse collection of information, readers should keep in mind that the book is not intended to serve as a detailed reference. Designed for children, the book offers only brief treatment of some subjects. (For instance, fighting in many arenas is discussed, although naval participation is not fully explained.) <p>Locating specific topics through the table of contents may be difficult unless students are already familiar with the history of the Civil War. The index is only two and a half pages, and students who have found a desired topic may not necessarily find other relevant information that is of interest because entries are not cross-referenced and not all of the side notes and human interest articles in the book are listed in the index. Although a few terms are defined within the text, a glossary of names and terms for quick reference is not included.<p>Providing a reference source, however, is not the only goal of a work such as this. Another is getting students to see themselves as a part of America's history so that they are turned on to the <I>study</I> of it. <B>Scholastic Encyclopedia of the Civil War</B>'s artful use of human interest articles and eye-catching visuals of real people may help students make that connection.<p><I>Julia Rose is curator of education at Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

1672|465013694|\N|The Cousins' Wars: Religion, Politics, & the Triumph of Anglo-America|Cousins' Wars: Religion, Politics, & the Triumph of Anglo-America The|Phillips, Kevin|\N|\N|"In <B>The Cousins' Wars</B>, Kevin Phillips gives a remarkable account of the evolution of today's dominant power bloc and culture -- the Anglo-American one, whose language is the international tongue of commerce, computers, and air travel, and whose stronger partner, America, dominates the world, militarily and economically. The book focuses on the three principal conflicts within that culture which, he argues, largely shaped it: the English and U.S. Civil Wars and the American Revolution.<p>Phillips shows how \recurrent threads\"" connect the three conflicts: alignments of wartime loyalty that at least partly repeated themselves, together with the effect of each outcome in chastening aristocracy, monarchy, or High Church religion and in spurring economic modernization and westward or commercial expansion.\"" The author illustrates the sheer complexity of the divided loyalties in the English-speaking world in each conflict and outlines the little-known role of Americans on both sides of the English Civil War. He even reveals that this reviewer's own local paper, the <I>Kentish Gazette</I> (still publishing today under the same name), opposed military action against the colonists in the American Revolution.<p>The impact of Britain on the U.S. Civil War, and, in turn, its impact on Britain and her New World possessions (Canada and the West Indies) are carefully described. Throughout, Phillips identifies two communities in Britain: Eastern/Dutch/Puritan versus Northern and Western/Episcopalian/Catholic and illustrates their sister cultures in New England and the South. (The latter two were in temporary alliance in the American Revolution, but the Eastern/Puritan English were still sympathetic to their Yankee cousins.)<p>Rejecting the fashion for determinism, Phillips points out that any of the three wars easily could have gone the other way. He even hints that the British military commander, General Howe (who, ironically, doubled as a Member of Parliament elected on an anti-war platform), may have deliberately thrown decisive victory away by failing to support Burgoyne's Saratoga campaign. Lincoln is recognized for his brilliance in forging an unlikely coalition: he brought New England Yankees together with groups such as the Catholic Irish and the Germans whom they otherwise regarded as enemies.<p>Phillips is quite clear as to whom he believes deserved to win in each case: \""On the one side, in each war, were commerce, industry . . . reformist evangelical religion, and the proselytizing middle class. On the other side was landed agriculture, with its feudal remnants and hierarchical religion and its greater ratios of horsemen, soldiers, and cavaliers. At a certain point in each nation's history, it was a necessity . . . for the former to push aside the latter.\""<p>While revealing his own view, he tries hard to be fair regarding the second and third of the three wars. For example, he reminds us of the extent to which the British defended American Indian rights against the colonists' aggression; he outlines the tariff demands of the North, which so threatened a Southern economy reliant on free trade; and he exposes the hypocrisy of the North in abandoning the blacks as soon as victory and Reconstruction had delivered Yankee commercial objectives.<p>Phillips is a political writer. This remarkable historical work is a bold attempt to underpin his individualistic Whig Protestant philosophy by tracing its successes through the generations. For those committed to an older, more traditional, organic conservatism, it cries out for an historical reply from a \""Tory\"" historian of equal standing. Phillips's striving for balance in the latter two \""Cousins' Wars\"" ultimately is undermined by his unbalanced analysis of the English Civil War, grounded in a fleeting caricature of the previous century, the century of the Reformation. Indeed, he paints the English Reformation as a straightforward matter of economic progress.<p>Yet, in his landmark novels, the (future) British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disr'li, a lapsed Anglican of Jewish origin, raised the battle cry for social and political reform in the Victorian Era by calling for a return to the institutions of pre-Reformation England. He paints it as a land of astonishing opportunity, in which a shepherd's son had risen to be pope and where social provision, from relief of poverty to education, was provided by the Church. He denounces Henry VIII's new <I>arriviste</I> upper middle class for seizing assets (including closing all the hospitals in London) and permanently kicking away the very ladders they had climbed, fossilizing the English class structure for centuries.<p>Phillips makes no mention of the popular risings (often unarmed) against these changes in the north and west of England. Nor is there a word about the hideous massacres of the protesters ordered by Henry VIII, sometimes using German mercenaries. He records with disapproval, however, the horrible moral decay into which these areas had descended two generations later. For Phillips, the rallying in these areas of such downtrodden people to a broad-minded king -- whom they perceived as standing against the tyranny of the new masters and their Dutch friends -- is just a matter of ignorance and graft. This alternate viewpoint is mentioned only indirectly, in a brief reference to a Confederate philosopher, George Fitzhugh, who harked back to the writings of Royalist Sir Robert Filmer.<p><B>The Cousins' War</B> lists a catalogue of British Victorian reforms as triumphs of \""British Whig and Liberal politics,\"" yet many of the items listed, from Catholic Emancipation to reform of public health and urban conditions, were wholly or mainly Tory/Conservative measures, several of them introduced by Disr'li!<p>For Phillips human motivation is about ideology (religious and secular) and economics. He has little use for the organic institutions, arguably the best in the world, developed in Saxon and Medieval England. The Saxon Moots and Witan -- parent of Parliament and Congress -- are discussed just once. The early Norman kings combined Norman officers with the redoubtable Saxon Fyrd (militia), giving victories at Tinchebray, Crecy, and Agincourt; modernized by Elizabeth I in 1576, they begat the New World colonial militias and thence the Minutemen (and today's National Guard). <B>The Cousins' Wars</B> does not mention the pivotal role of these institutions at all.<p>Nor does it ask why individual Confederate soldiers -- most of them neither slave-owners nor experts on tariffs -- fought so unbelievably courageously for the South; or what role these militias played in the motivation of one of the best citizen armies of all time, which almost defeated a major industrial power. In his leap from the third \""Cousins' War\"" to today, Phillips does not pause to ask what part the Crown, which he obviously despises, played in stiffening British morale and in attracting gallant volunteers from around the Empire. Churchill believed that the Crown played a vital part in the lonely British stand against Hitler. <p>Only a writer for whom political theory heroically transcends institutional detail could say \""the Restoration Parliament had wiped away Cromwell's electoral reforms and banned further democratization,\"" albeit a decent interval after admitting that Cromwell had abolished Parliament and ruled as a dictator.<p>This is a heavyweight work; in its own terms, a landmark. Somewhere, there must be a Tory historian to give it the reply it deserves.<p><I>A former Oxford scholar and Territorial Army officer, Julian Brazier is Member of Parliament for Canterbury.</I>"""|Brazier, Julian|Fall 1999|9/1/1999|Review|Did America's Civil War originate in England's?|Inheritance of conflict|Basic Books|0000-00-00|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N

1717|1556523556|\N|The Civil War for Kids: A History with 21 Activities|Civil War for Kids: A History with 21 Activities The|Herbert, Janis|\N|\N|"<p>For children who <I>really</I> want to know what it felt like to take an active role in the past, <B>The Civil War for Kids</B> is <I>it</I>! The cast of characters to choose from is large. Sol-diers, nurses, officers, reporters, artists, doctors, spies, presidents, wives, and children play key roles. These well-known and not-so-known courageous individuals are brought to life through their own words in this activity book.<p>Unlike most books for children that skirt the details or concentrate on just one aspect or on one side of the War, <B>The Civil War for Kids</B> doesn't leave much out. The author, Janis Herbert, takes great pains to tell both sides of a dramatic story and fills the book with archival photographs and illustrations, maps, little-known facts, short biographies, and plenty of activities. To help put all this information in perspective and guide the reader to know even more, she includes a resource section, glossary, timeline, bibliography, and list of officers.<p>Young men and women will find plenty of interest and plenty to do, as suggested by the title of the book. The title, however, is unnecessarily modest, since many adults, especially teachers and librarians, may also appreciate the details and activities contained in this work.<p>Instead of being standard textbook fare, <B>The Civil War for Kids</B> is written simply, with drama, tension, and purpose. The reasons for the War's outbreak and how the War was played out are clearly presented.  Battles are fully described -- with all the anticipation and horror. Herbert puts herself in the midst of the War as she narrates events play-by-play.  Here she \captures\"" the start of Pickett's famous charge:<p>\""Then, silence fell. The Rebel artillery, running out of ammunition, wanted to save enough to support their infantry charge. The Union guns, too, became quiet. Pickett, eager to do his part in this battle, looked anxiously for Longstreet to ask permission to advance. General Longstreet, not wishing to send his friend and the men into this desperate charge, couldn't bring himself to speak. He nodded his head in answer to Pickett's request.\""<p>The soldier's life is fully described. Although the bulk of the book is devoted to Confederate and Union soldiers on the battlefield, the reader also follows them during drill exercises, in camp waiting for battle, on the march, and in makeshift prisons and hospitals. Herbert stays close to the soldiers to highlight their excitement, determination, frustration, boredom, fear -- even their sense of fun:<p>\""Lice were a real annoyance in the camps, but the soldiers found one way to make light of the problem. They would place the lice on plates and hold races to see which one could cross its plate first! One soldier won every time. His friends, suspecting a trick, found out that he got his lice to run faster by heating his plate before the race.\""<p><B>The Civil War for Kids</B> also features other witnesses to the War, as well as those who experienced its effects off the battlefield. A chapter devoted to writers, artists, photographers, and reporters spotlights some of the classic literary works, memoirs, and diaries that were written during the War. While Herbert showcases women who served the War as spies, nurses, or even soldiers, she also briefly explains what life at home was like for many women and children. She even includes a short article on what daily life was like for both presidents.<p>Herbert also covers slavery before the War, life in the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, and the roles of Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, and Robert Smalls. She travels with black soldiers who join in the fighting, although little is said about how slaves and free blacks at home were affected by the War and aftermath.<p>One aspect of the book that readers might find disappointing is the limited scope of the activities. Most are not simple, and some will not be inviting. All except for a few involve life on or near the battlefield -- from drill exercises to acting out Antietam to playing general to building a lean-to shelter -- and will be appealing to those caught up in the War's details and strategies. Some of these might work better as classroom exercises because they require several players.<p>Yet the book's strengths far outweigh any shortcomings. <B>The Civil War for Kids</B> introduces the Civil War's well-known stories and characters as well as the little-known facts and unknown players. It is a great way for readers to learn more about the Civil War and to appreciate what history is all about.<p><i>Carolyn P.

For many baby-boomers, the political turmoil of the early 1970s can be visualized by recalling <I>Doonesbury</I>'s portrayal of the brick wall appearing around the Nixon White House. Editor Kristen M. Smith, a journalist and cartoonist, has compiled more than 130 cartoon samples that cover the gamut of political partisanship with caricatures of politicians and generals and depictions of draft dodgers, war profiteers, army recruiters, and Northern Copperheads.<p>Some of the drawings are crude; others include distracting, crowded dialogue balloons. Dreadful puns may be lost on contemporary readers, but a few of the pieces sparkle with clever incisiveness. For example, an 1860 Currier & Ives lithograph captioned \The Nigger' in the Woodpile\"" features Horace Greeley assuring a voter that the Republican Party \""has no connection with the Abolition party,\"" while a beardless Abraham Lincoln clings to the top of a pyramid of split rails (labeled \""Republican Platform\"") as a grinning black man peers out from within.<p>Although <B>The Lines Are Drawn</B> provides a useful sampling, several problems undermine its effectiveness. The editor's selection criteria are never adequately explained. The inclusion of examples from the Confederacy is an admirable attempt at balance, but only A.J. Volck's cartoons measure up to the standards set by Northern artists. The organization of the book is logical, but lacks focus. Subjects like race, dissent, and politics are mentioned without being explained, and the chronological format isolates cartoons that may have been more thoroughly understood in topical sections.<p>This lack of contextual focus carries over into the explanatory paragraphs, which often provide useful, if basic, information but rarely connect one cartoon to another. Some seem misinterpreted. For instance, a confusing scene on page 127 showing U.S. Grant destroying a golden idol as financiers kneel before it is somehow explained as a reference to Grant overturning his predecessors' timid military strategy, and on page 144 a one-legged white veteran shaking hands with a one-legged black veteran over the caption \""A Man Knows A Man\"" is surprisingly identified as a former Confederate.<p>Political cartoons can be potent avenues of research for historians, as many of the examples in this volume prove. William F. Thompson showed how to incorporate history with artistry in <I>The Image of War</I>, a minor classic about the sketch artists traveling with the Union armies. A truly useful study of wartime cartoons would take similar care in establishing contexts and explaining the images that can tell us so much about this era of crisis.<p><I>James Marten is associate professor of history at Marquette University and author of </I>Texas Divided: Loyalty and Dissent in the Lone Star State, 1856-1874 <i>and</i> The Children's Civil War."""|Marten, James|Fall 1999|9/1/1999|Review|Political commentary through cartoons|Rough sketches|Hill Street Press|0000-00-00|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N

1803|395867606|\N|Controversies & Commanders: Dispatches from the Army of the Potomac|Controversies & Commanders: Dispatches from the Army of the Potomac|Sears, Stephen W.|\N|\N|"Civil War historians have discovered once again the power of essay collections. Whether multiple-authored under an editor's guiding hand, or created by a single accomplished writer like Stephen Sears (as in the case of the present volume), they nearly always provide new wine for old vessels. In short, they yield distinctively focused snapshots of particular themes, events, or person'. Sears thus joins other recent vintners like Gabor Boritt, Gary Gallagher, James McPherson, and Steven Woodworth in selecting an area where talent and interest combine to give us new thoughts and dimensions of some exciting issues. In Sears's case, the theme concerns controversial leadership in the Army of the Potomac.<p>Sears's forte is \Mr. Lincoln's Army,\"" although his principal concentration in the past has been the rather formative period of that military instrument. Readers will immediately associate his name with the study of the archetypical controversial leader George B. McClellan and the Peninsula and Maryland campaigns in which the general figured so prominently. More recently, Sears has expanded his field of vision to include Chancellorsville and the juxtaposition of Joseph Hooker with the immortal Lee and Jackson as battlefield and army commanders.<p>Now, in <B>Controversies & Commanders</B>, the author uses ten distinctive essays to dissect this phlegmatic army's performance and response to a variety of leadership styles and personalities. Fully half the chapters refer to the early period of the army's existence. And again, as might be expected, the leitmotif remains the preeminent <I>minence grise</I> -- McClellan, his presence, his influence, and his legacy.<p>Sears commences the journey with an analysis of how historians have handled \""Little Mac.\"" He follows that introductory essay with chapters defining the September 1862 campaign which saw McClellan's restoration to army command over the opposition of virtually everyone in Washington (with even Abraham Lincoln less than pleased with his own necessary decision). Sears then contributes some \""last thoughts\"" about the famous Lost Order of the Maryland campaign in which he advances how, if nothing more, the finding of Lee's campaign plan decidedly affected the unfolding of events.<p>Additional chapters illustrate McClellan's influence over events and people as Sears describes the sacking of relatively obscure Brigadier Charles P. Stone (for the Balls Bluff debacle) and better known corps commander Fitz John Porter (for noncooperation with Pope at Second Bull Run). In both cases, he implies, their association with \""Little Mac\"" contributed to their demise with the army.<p>Next comes an especially winsome piece on \""the Revolt of the Generals\"" against Ambrose Burnside that plays back to the continuing existence of McClellan's \""old boy network,\"" which plagued a continuously unsuccessful army. One wonders if the Army of the Potomac ever truly overcame its \""infatuation\"" with this wannabe American Napoleon. That the Union finally did so is suggested by Sears's handling of the lingering ghosts of McClellan. Sears puts them to rest in one sense as he leaves us with the perception that by re-reading McClellan's own words, we can finally decide whether a McClellan victory at the polls in 1864 and elevation to the presidency six months later would have appreciably changed the vigorous prosecution of the Union war effort to ultimate suppression of the rebellion. He concludes that \""Little Mac\"" as well as Lincoln saw subjugation of the Confederacy as the ultimate war aim. Of course, their methods differed substantially.<p>When Sears turns to the middle and latter periods of the Army of the Potomac's mottled history, he uncovers several episodes of note, but possibly loses an opportunity to explore and explain better the army's singularly unsung but possibly most intriguing commander. True, Sears does a superb job of rehabilitating \""Fighting Joe\"" Hooker from some unjust criticism. He sees the cannon ball-disabling of the army commander as more instructive in explaining Chancellorsville than any preemptive brilliance of Lee and Jackson. <p>Less controversial will be his chapter about the ineptness of that quirky politico-general Dan Sickles, whose claim to rank and reputation was forever washed away by the bloodbath on the second day at Gettysburg. It is here, however, that Sears fumbled a golden opportunity to include something major about General George Meade, although the Pennsylvanian remains the butt of Sickles's postwar efforts at rescue and redemption in the Sickles chapter. We simply need to know more about Meade and the late-war army in a period largely made obscure by the presence of General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant travelling with the Army of the Potomac and rendering some rather controversial decisions on its behalf.<p>Sears concludes his volume with several episodes that suggest the presence of controversial leadership still apparent in the late-war army. A vignette of the very questionable sacking of corps commander Gouverneur K. Warren by Grant and his favorite, Philip Sheridan, (apparently with Meade's acquiescence) is particularly striking. But, this was certainly a classic reflection of organizational management response between \""old\"" and \""new\"" -- the clash of Western and Eastern army generals and their military style and culture. Sears could have amplified the incident in that context, rather than merely emphasizing late-war injustice to a loyal subordinate like Warren.<p>The hour was late, the conflict needed termination, and men like Grant and Sheridan could brook no further lethargy in a vigorous thrust to the hilt. Warren seemingly reflected the Army of the Potomac's traditional inability to administer any <I>coup de grce</I>. An example had to be set -- no matter that the individual's previous service was exemplary. Perhaps the damage was so slight because Appomattox loomed so near.<p>Sears's seeming genuflection to the arms and services that undergirded the Army of the Potomac comes in a chapter examining the tangential but controversial raid on Richmond, which was engineered by the questionably competent Judson Kilpatrick and his Byronesque subordinate, Ulric Dahlgren, largely for the purpose of kidnapping Jefferson Davis and attacking the Confederacy's central nervous system. What it all amounted to was quite divorced from the main operations of the Army of the Potomac and spoke more to a bizarre late-war twist of spawning a \""get the king\"" game -- which, of course, eventually resulted in Lincoln's assassination.<p>Surely some other examination of use or misuse of Eastern cavalry or even artillery -- or better, a consideration of the logistical branches of the army's overall performance -- would have made for a more rounded treatment. But, of course, such topics might be less entertaining and might potentially contravene Sears's avowed theme of controversies and commanders. Best that they be left to another place and time no matter how much better they might inform us of the war machine that was the Army of the Potomac.<p>How then to assess Sears's effort? Comfortably documented, it provides readers with an unshowy, crisp book that should delight the Round Table set and students of the War in the East. The work needs maps since much of the discussion relates to operations as well as personalities. Most certainly, <B>Controversies & Commanders</B> speaks to the topics clearly enunciated in earlier years by Bruce Catton -- the political machinations, the controversial helmsmanship, the notoriety of the middle rank figures as well as the principal field force of the Union \""that could have lost the war in a single afternoon.\"" That Sears's work has seemingly downplayed (if not omitted) the central role of Lincoln in \""Mr. Lincoln's Army\"" needs to be clearly understood. But, here is an easily read, enjoyable jaunt that will complement the work of Noah Trudeau, Gordon Rhea, and others who continue to find stimulating themes in the campaigns from the Mason-Dixon line to southside Virginia in the battle for the capitals.<p><I>Benjamin Franklin Cooling, author or editor of numerous works of Civil War, military, and naval history, is professor of grand strategy and mobilization at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces of the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.</I>"""|Cooling, Benjamin Franklin|Fall 1999|9/1/1999|Review|McClellan, his friends and foes, and Union Army squabbles|American Napoleon|Houghton Mifflin|0000-00-00|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N
1804|452281393|\N|Gettysburg 1863: Campaign of Endless Echoes|Gettysburg 1863: Campaign of Endless Echoes|Wheeler, Richard|\N|\N|"What makes Gettysburg so constantly engaging? One of America's most decisive battles, it shattered the mythic invincibility surrounding Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia, and, along with the fall of Vicksburg, it began the South's long agony to Appomattox. But something more causes rising interest in the Pennsylvania battle: at Gettysburg the past is \not even past,\"" and myths and possibilities seem to haunt history.<p>Gettysburg has attracted much fine writing. Richard Wheeler's <B>Gettysburg 1863</B> ranks with the best. His easy, flowing style lets him tuck in people, scenes, observations, and new information without wrecking the narrative. He lets his characters develop awhile before the battle, and as a result, Lee, Meade, and their important subordinates are real and come off the pages in the crucible of action.<p>Casting a wide lens, Wheeler looks at the Confederate victory at Chancellorsville as perhaps triggering Lee's perception that his army was dauntless. Wheeler follows Union General Joseph Hooker's squirming after Chancellorsville through his replacement by Meade and traces Lee northward in late June 1863. The great cavalry battle at Brandy Station is reconstructed to show how Jeb Stuart's chagrin at this near defeat for the Confederates contributed to his decision to make the unwise wagon raid into Maryland. The lens focuses as the armies concentrate near Gettysburg. Wheeler sets a clear view of the town scene, showing how citizens met the ragged Rebels flooding the streets.<p>Tension mounts at Union and Confederate headquarters as the first and second days of the battle pass in a swirl of hectic fighting, and of chances taken, missed, or debated. The third day fills with oddities as Longstreet opposes a charge against Meade's center. Lee overrules Longstreet's suggestion to turn the Union flank and orders the frontal charge. Flamboyant George Pickett makes ready to lead, while the Rebel artillery begins a fearsome bombardment that roils some of Meade's front line and flails Federal wagon parks and depots -- and nearly empties Rebel caissons.<p>Battle narrative is a special Wheeler gift. Description of the three days' fighting around Gettysburg pulls the reader straight into the sound, fury, and anguish of Culp's Hill, Devil's Den, the Cemetery, and the Round Tops. The charge on July 3 is executed with all the furies of impossible gallantry. Wheeler's lens sweeps the whole of Pickett's Charge and zooms in on men trying to keep formation as they fall, and on the Union line holding steadily against artillery and the awesome mass in gray. Clearly seen are the survivors as they stream down the hill to meet a contrite Lee.<p>Wheeler is careful and sound in his assessment of why Meade did not pursue Lee's troops, despite constant urging from Washington. Although respectful of Lee's retreat from Gettysburg, Wheeler is nevertheless highly critical of Lee's plan and actions during the whole campaign. He reproaches the Confederate leader for permitting Stuart's quixotic raid that left the army without vital intelligence before and during the battle.<p>Scattered throughout the text are line drawings that evoke the period and depict the participants. Wheeler deliberately avoided reference notes because he thought they would only confuse readers. This omission is unfortunate because readers might have enjoyed pursuing new sources presented by the author. The bibliography is helpful (despite some omissions), but footnotes would have been even more helpful.<p><I>Frank E.

1805|783501005|\N|The Civil War: A Narrative (40th Anniversary Edition)|Civil War: A Narrative (40th Anniversary Edition) The|Foote, Shelby|\N|\N|"Shelby Foote, the Mississippi-born, currently Tennessee-based novelist and historian became something of a celebrity after his appearances in Ken Burns's PBS television series, The Civil War. Foote was enlisted as a narrator because of his exhaustive knowledge of the subject and his reputation as historian extraordinaire, which he secured from the publication of his monumental three-volume work <B>The Civil War: A Narrative</B>.<p>Now Time-Life Books is issuing a 14-volume 40th anniversary edition, illustrated with historical photographs, battle maps, drawings, paintings, and other works of art culled from Time-Life's collection. This is, of course, not the first time a photo narrative of the Civil War has been published. Francis T. Miller's famous ten-volume work, The Photographic History of the Civil War (1912), was reissued in 1987, sadly with poor quality halftone reproductions. Ken Burns's companion volume to his PBS series is wonderfully illustrated with period photographs, battle maps, paintings, etc. Yet <B>The Civil War: A Narrative</B> offers a unique charm.<p>Foote has written a very informative introduction to the first volume, giving details of the genesis of his book, especially of his relationship to Random House publisher Bennett Cerf (who originally had commissioned a single volume to be titled <I>A Short History of the Civil War</I>). Our author's passion toward his subject produced a work seven times larger than originally planned. The completed text consisted of three volumes, released in 1958, 1963, and 1974, respectively. A predecessor to this edition, brought out in 1991, was a sumptuous three-volume, limited, signed, \Collector's Edition, Bound in Genuine Leather\"" reissue by the Easton Press, which was published in a red morocco gilt-stamped leather binding.<p>The binding of this 40th anniversary collector's edition is of a nice oatmeal-colored paper, with the illustrated dust jackets of the 14 volumes collectively forming a photograph of a Federal infantry drill at a Washington, D.C., camp in early 1862. Foote has written a prologue and epilogue for each book. Foote's approach to the War is weighted toward military matters, although the politics of the conflict are addressed in the process. He deals with the Union and the Confederacy, in both Eastern and Western theaters of the War. The author's literary background makes reading this work so enjoyable, featuring as it does a flowing pace like that of a good novel.<p>The first volume covers the prelude to the War, notably the perspectives of Presidents Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln, and takes note of the major events of the first ten months, especially the conflicts at Fort Sumter and Manassas. The second volume deals with the first six months of 1862, with special emphasis on Shiloh, the assaults on New Orleans and Memphis, and the famed battle between the <I>Monitor</I> and the <I>Merrimac</I>. In volume three, Foote focuses on the events of the spring and early summer of 1862, including the campaigns of Stonewall Jackson and George McClellan, activities in the West, and Braxton Bragg's move to Chattanooga. Volume four gives attention to the Second Manassas, the subsequent Confederate invasions of the Northern territories, and Kirby Smith's invasion of Kentucky, with events leading up to the Emancipation Proclamation. In volume five, Foote recounts events of late 1862 and early 1863, with special attention to the battles of Fredericksburg, Walnut Hills, and Murfreesboro, plus Ulysses Grant's bayou ventures.<p>In addition to the prologues and epilogues which Foote has written expressly for the edition, the inclusion of illustrations distinguishes this Time-Life series from earlier printings.<p>As a photographic historian, I am always interested in seeing how illustrations -- photographs or not -- are incorporated into a book, especially when the book deals with one subject matter. In examining the first five volumes, I find that there has been a judicious choice of photographs, maps, lithographs, and sketches. Both the black-and-white and color reproductions are very good. Proper crediting of the illustrations' ownership is given at the back of each volume. Many are from the great Meserve Collection and The Library of Congress. However, in not one instance did I notice a credit of the original photographer or artist, although in some cases the photographer of the copy print is given credit (which could mislead some people to think that the credited person was the maker of the original picture). Therein lies a problem with this 40th anniversary edition of Foote's work. It is unclear whether it was caused by a lack of information or a lack of knowledge about where to find such information.<p>Aside from that one failing, this 40th anniversary edition is an enjoyable read and a visual delight, whether one is reading it for the first time or once again.<p><I>Michl Hargraves has served for 12 years as a cataloguer in the Department of Photographs at the J.

1806|1883522153|\N|Red-Tape and Pigeon-Hole Generals: Andrew A. Humphreys in the Army of the Potomac|Red-Tape and Pigeon-Hole Generals: Andrew A. Humphreys in the Army of the Potomac|Armstrong, William H.|Arner, Frederick B.|\N|With <B>Red-Tape and Pigeon-Hole Generals</B>, Fred Arner has established himself as a champion of the Army of the Potomac's downtrodden and an assailant of its legendary elite. In a previous work, <I>Mutiny at Brandy Station</I>, Arner dissected the causes and personalities associated with an uprising in the Union Third Corps during the winter of 1864 -- an analysis that reflected warmly on the common soldiers and poorly on the subordinate command of the Army of the Potomac. In <B>Red-Tape and Pigeon-Hole Generals</B>, Arner continues the trend, resurrecting a scathing assessment of Andrew Humphreys (one of the Union cause's most respected figures) written by one of Humphreys's contemporaries.<p>Most historians have long consigned <B>Red-Tape and Pigeon-Hole Generals</B> (written anonymously in 1864) to the bin of fiction. The book contains unidentified characters in a fictionalized regiment commanded by fictionalized officers. Why the anonymous author chose this approach becomes clear in the first few chapters: published in wartime, this is an unvarnished, harsh recounting of the relationship between a mercurial regular army officer (Humphreys, although not named in the text) and the nation's volunteer fighters, the very core of the Union war effort. Without its fictive pretense, this work would have been an enormous indictment of the army's management at a time when the North -- split deeply by political division -- could least afford it.<p>Fred Arner has done diligent and useful work to peel away the veil of fiction that has obscured this book. He identifies the regiment in question: the 129th Pennsylvania, a nine-month regiment that saw heavy service in the East from Antietam to Chancellorsville. He reveals the author (Lieutenant Colonel William H. Armstrong of the 129th), the major protagonists (Colonel Jacob Frick of the 129th and his Pennsylvania Volunteers), and the primary antagonist, Major General Andrew Atkinson Humphreys, commander of the division of nine-month Pennsylvania Volunteers and later chief of staff of the army.<p>With the characters established, the book is transformed from a seemingly mindless diatribe against a vile general and his Regular Army cohorts into an important book that reflects -- perhaps more vividly than any other -- the tension between old army discipline and new, eager, and often slack volunteer soldiers.<p>The reader must, however, beware. The long recounting of conversations are a sure sign that they are fabricated or loosely reconstructed -- not to be relied upon. Also, Arner, in his ardor to embrace the indictment of Humphreys portrayed here, is considerably less keen on presenting favorable testimony about the general than he ought to be (there is much such material out there, to be sure). This is no balanced assessment. Still, it is a useful piece of work and interesting reading that ought to find a place on the shelf of anyone interested in the Army of the Potomac.<p><I>John Hennessy, author of </I>Return to Bull Run<I>, writes from Fredericksburg, Virginia.</I>|Hennessy, John|Fall 1999|9/1/1999|Review|One common soldier's satire of the Union officer corps|The Humphreys nobody knows|Rockbridge Publishing|0000-00-00|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N

Thomas|\N|\N|"The resources of the Southern Confederacy were pitifully small at the outset of the Civil War, and they dwindled steadily as the struggle ran its course. This was especially the case with the South's naval efforts. Lacking a fleet or any hope of building one, Confederate accomplishments were singular, piecemeal, and occasionally quite successful.<p>Such escapades are not in this book. Rather, R. Thomas Campbell's fourth volume on Confederate ventures at sea treats a little-known aspect: the naval college established midway through the war. Modeled after the U.S. Naval Academy and designed to train young men for junior-grade ranks, the school did its best with what it had at hand. Its saga was brief and undramatic, heroic but of limited value.<p>Campbell has pulled together all the bits and pieces obtainable for this story of the naval school. Diary excerpts are included if they were found; huge chunks of Superintendent William H. Parker's printed and well-known memoirs are incorporated. When a midshipman wrote an account of any isolated action or observation on naval life, it too is included.<p>Although Campbell attempts to follow a chronological path, lack of source material often leaves the chapters as individual and unconnected theses.<p>The school opened in November 1863. The \campus\"" was the C.S.S. <I>Patrick Henry</I>, anchored at Drewry's Bluff in the James River below Richmond. Fifty-two midshipmen composed the student body.

The top graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy Class of 1847, Parker had the distinction of serving aboard both the U.S.S. <I>Merrimack</I> and the C.S.S. <I>Virginia</I> prior to taking charge of the young officers-to-be.<p>Following biographical sketches of other faculty members is a section devoted to the school-ship. Originally christened the <I>Yorktown</I>, the vessel was the <I>Patrick Henry</I> when she participated in the March 1862 naval battle of Hampton Roads. The side-wheeler remained in use as an academy until it burned in the evacuation of Richmond.<p>Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen Mallory receives deserved discussion. The innovative Floridian knew his fledgling navy would never be big enough to swap punches with the more established, greater-supplied U.S. Navy. So Mallory resorted to revolutionary weapons: ironclad ships, torpedoes (mines), tactical submarines, and the like.<p>There was a moment or two of drama for the midshipmen. In February 1864, eight of them were part of a raiding team that captured the U.S.S. <I>Underwriter</I> near New Bern, N.C. Three months later, 19 of the students joined the James River Squadron to contest Union General Benjamin F. Butler's army-navy advance up the river. Each naval group more or less bottled up the other. The midshipmen then returned to school until November, when all of the youngsters were ordered on active duty to assist hard-pressed Confederate forces. That was basically the end of the academy.<p>Campbell includes a number of appendices: a photo gallery of midshipmen, a roster of the academy, a list of midshipmen assigned while overseas, regulations for the naval school and of the <I>Patrick Henry</I>, plus other tidbits.<p>\""The fact that the school existed at all is simply astounding,\"" the author concludes. \""Even more remarkable is the success that the school enjoyed in spite of the terrible war that raged around it. School boys one day, soldiers the next, and yet through it all, the Academy was able to train and graduate these boys as junior naval officers who were second to none. In fact, they were no doubt superior to many, for their classroom instruction had been supplemented by active operational experiences.\""<p>Campbell has sought earnestly to tell the academy's full story. Lack of sources blocked that objective. If the author occasionally relies too heavily on lengthy quotations from printed sources, it was the result of an honest effort to make the chronicle as complete as possible. No question exists but that the fragments woven together here are the fullest account of the Confederate Naval Academy this age will ever see.<p><I>James I.

Ringle's <B>Life in Mr. Lincoln's Navy</B> is both a groundbreaking work of naval history and a pleasure to read. Ringle chronicles the Union navy from the antebellum reform movement to the steam-powered <I>Monitor</I>-class ironclad. Moreover, this well-researched book is a compendium of life at sea, viewed largely from the perspective of the enlisted sailor: what he wore, ate, drank, treated his illnesses with, and did with his spare time. The reader is introduced to the entire spectrum of a sailor's naval career, from his recruitment, training, and assignment to his death or discharge.<p>Using a wide variety of primary sources, including ships' logs and papers, naval records, sailors' diaries, and even letters, Ringle presents all aspects of Civil War naval warfare. Two topics deserve particular mention: the challenges of keeping ships adequately manned with trained and experienced sailors and the logistical system necessary to run the seagoing war machine.<p>The Union navy suffered from severe fluctuations in manpower at the outset of the War, but sound policy decisions and the foresight of leaders such as Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles produced a more stable influx of seamen. As it grew in terms of manpower, the navy underwent an uncomfortable transformation in warships, one that required a new breed of sailor. It is this movement from sail to steam that Ringle captures best.<p>Drawing on his own experience as an engineering officer, the author identifies the need for technical professionals trained to run the increasingly complex engineering plants of Union ships, such as John Ericsson's <I>Monitor</I>, as the impetus for the creation of the engineering ratings. The engineers, although not initially welcomed alongside the tradition-bound deck ratings, quickly proved indispensable.<p>The logistical hurdles to supplying \Mr. Lincoln's Navy\"" with the requisite food, coal, and ammunition were enormous, particularly given the tasks the navy was charged with: enforcing a sustained and unprecedented blockade, supporting the Union army, and hunting Confederate vessels. Ringle explains in convincing detail how the navy developed the means of procuring and distributing matriel to an armada stretched along the coast of North America. <p>The navy was not alone in its resupply efforts. Ever eager to make a buck, sutler ships commanded by enterprising merchant captains helped fill matriel requirements that navy supply ships alone could not. This logistical success also helps explain why the Union sailor was better clothed, better trained, better fed, and more likely to survive combat injuries than either his army counterpart or his Confederate enemy.<p><I>Timothy J.

The Civil War is no exception. In <B>Friendly Fire in the Civil War</B>, Webb Garrison chronicles incidents of friendly fire in over 100 Civil War battles.<p>Written in a style that will appeal to most Civil War enthusiasts, Garrison's exploration of friendly fire is both informative and readable. This unique work examines not only the Civil War's famous cases of friendly fire (for example, the mortal wounding of Confederate General Thomas \Stonewall\"" Jackson during the Battle of Chancellorsville), but also little known episodes of men in the same army killing each other.<p>The author examined scores of diaries and memoirs to uncover instances of friendly fire. His research shows that from the smallest skirmish to the largest battlefield, the Civil War saw an astounding number of friendly fire incidents.<p>While Garrison writes that on occasion confusion, excitement, and obstructed views led to many episodes of misdirected attacks, he argues that better training, discipline, and leadership would have significantly lowered the number of these lamentable incidents. In the case of Jackson's wounding, Garrison describes how Major John Barry of the 18th North Carolina ordered his men to shoot, despite General A. P. Hill's shouting that they were hitting comrades.<p>Garrison also argues that with victory as the only goal for Yankees and Rebels alike, officers spent little time contemplating or correcting actions they considered minor in comparison to the overall carnage seen in the Civil War. Some officers even became calloused to causing the injury or death of their comrades. In one case, Union General William \""Bull\"" Nelson ordered the pilot of a steamship that was transporting Nelson's Ohio Volunteers to Pittsburg Landing to plow full speed through a mass of blue clad men who, after being defeated around the Shiloh Church, were attempting to swim across the Tennessee River to safety.<p>Though some of Garrison's examples may not rise to the level of friendly fire -- for instance, injury caused by wooden sabots falling off artillery shells and landing among allies -- his study sheds light on a little known, yet disturbingly prevalent, aspect of America's Civil War.<p><I>E.

Thomas|\N|"<br>For the most powerful Civil War memoir by a general, turn to President Grant. For the most distinctive memoir by a citizen soldier, turn to Sam Watkins. Both can tell you a thing or two about war and soldiering, madness and sadness -- and much more. <p>In this standing column of <B>Civil War Book Review</B>, I will advocate either the reprinting of a Civil War classic, fiction or nonfiction, or I will review a current reprint. To suggest the kinds of books I tend to recommend, I will say that one of my favorite projects as director of the United States Civil War Center was to urge publishers to reprint Civil War classics. <p>This journal's premiere issue featured my review of <I>Secessionists and Other Scoundrels: Selections from Parson Brownlow's Book</I>, which I persuaded Louisiana State University Press to reprint. Also at my suggestion, they have reprinted John William DeForest's novel <I>Miss Ravenel's Conversion from Secession to Loyalty and his two memoirs of Civil War and Reconstruction: Alexander Stephen's Prison Diary</I>, and <I>Thirty Years After</I> by artist Edwin Forbes. Other works I have recommended for reprint that I can now recommend here are: Robert Penn Warren's novel <I>Wilderness</I> (University of Tennessee Press); Fletcher Pratt's <I>Short History of the Civil War</I> (Dover); </I>Coat of Blue, Coat of Gray</I> (Pelican), a novel for children; and <I>The Wave</I>, a novel by Evelyn Scott (University Press of Virginia).<p>I will never, I hope, need to advocate reprinting the <I>Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant </I>(Modern Library, $15.95, ISBN 0375752285). Watkins's beloved memoir (in print since 1962, at least) would need no advocate either, were it not for M. Thomas Inge's detective work, which turned up six published, forgotten, and uncollected articles by Watkins which cannot be found in the few other editions in print. These articles and the other major embellishments Inge has included in this new edition -- an introduction, a textual note, a chronology, \A Concise History of the First Tennessee Infantry Regiment,\"" a glossary, a topical index, a geographic index, and a biographical directory and index -- offered stellar competition against the existing editions and more than enough justification for my urging Plume to publish it and for my choosing to recommend it here.<p>Sam Watkins was only 41 when he started publishing installments of his memoirs in his hometown newspaper in Columbia, Tennessee, in 1881. His memory was sharp and so was his tongue. The more he tells about his experiences as a lowly private in the side show of the big show, the more disgusted we become with the officers' performances in the big tent (\""a fitting burlesque to tragic scenes\""). The show business metaphor is only one of an arsenal of rhetorical devices Watkins employs. In recounting 150 distinct episodes, from Shiloh, Corinth, Perryville, Knoxville, Murfreesboro, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, the Hundred Days Battles, Resaca, Atlanta, Franklin, and Nashville to war's end -- a fast-paced tour of major battles in both the Western and the Eastern campaigns -- Watkins moves with convincing ease from satire to pathos, from invective to laudation, from ridicule to compassion, from sarcasm to lyricism, from near-farce to black humor, from acid anecdote to trenchant generalization, from gory image to rhapsodic flights, and from excoriation of political and religious orators to exhortations of Divine Justice.<p>Watkins's prose is a veritable repository of rhetorical devices, from literary allusions to salty sayings to satirical punning. Have a sample or two: \""Keep up that feint movement until all the boys faint from sheer exhaustion.\"" \""We found the guard,\"" eleven men, \""hard frozen as the icicles that hung from their hands and faces and clothing.\"" Readers may be reminded of Twain's Southwestern tall tales, of Bierce's bizarre incidents, and of the picaresque novels of Fielding and Defoe. A master of Southern oral storyteller's style and Victorian literary style, Watkins meshes both.<p>To test one's ability to resist such richness, one might stand and read in a bookstore such brief episodes as \""A Night Among the Dead,\"" \""Ten Men Killed at the Mourners' Bench,\"" and \""The Death of Tom Tuck's Rooster.\"" Not to mention \""Eating Rats.\""<p>Too many memoirists seem passive witnesses. Watkins is an active participant. Getting wounded, being captured, escaping, and then almost drowning on a sinking steamboat are only a few of his misadventures. Need I mention that he has a girl at home and more than one away from home? He does things he is ashamed to admit. But he is unflinchingly honest about the catch-22 insanity of the military system in that \""long and unholy and uncalled for war\"": \""I shrink from butchery.\"" But about the execution of a deserter, who asks to drink rain water from his grave and who curses everybody and everything, Watkins say, flatly, \""I felt he deserved to die.\"" <p>With his many references to then and now and his shifts from past to present tense, Watkins creates a sense of several time dimensions existing simultaneously. \""Whit thought he was killed, but he is living yet.\"" The sense of painful immediacy the reader may feel derives partly from Watkins's compulsion to talk directly to his fellow veterans and to all who were not. \""Farewell, friend: we will meet over yonder,\"" he writes to his dead comrade. \""Reader mine, did you live in that stormy period?\"" He makes repeated allusions to the act of writing: \""I lay down my pen; I can write no more; my heart is too full. This is the saddest chapter I ever wrote.\"" And to the act of reading: \""as you are now reading these lines.\""<p>He often compares himself and other common soldiers with The Generals. \""The generals risked their reputations, the private soldier his life.\"" With bitter irony, he declares: \""I shot only at privates.\"" He often compares himself, as a small town newspaper memoirist, with historians. \""I know nothing of the battle. See the histories for that. I only write from memory.\"" But his experiences will seem to most readers far richer than that of the generals, maybe even Grant and Lee included. As for the historians, for over a century few have failed to draw, when appropriate -- and it often is -- on his testimony. <p>\""I only tell what I saw,\"" he admits, making no claim to historic fact. But the overriding fact is that what he didn't see or hear or know, what he misperceived, what he imagined, and, above all, the extraordinary power of the words he chose to express -- all that -- was as much a part of the history as any congeries of facts. A Bayeux tapestry of the Civil War would be woven of facts and figments, just as every history book is.<p>The only thing better than the Watkins millions have loved is more of the same, those six unknown articles and those enhancements with which Professor Inge has blessed us.<p><I>The United States Civil War Center grew out of David Madden's research for his Civil War novel</I> Sharpshooter. <I>The Center's founding director, Madden recently resigned that position to devote more time to a new novel set on ancient London Bridge during civil war, plague, and fire.</I><p>An abridged version of this column appears in the Fall 1999 print edition of <B>Civil War Book Review.</B>"""|Madden, David|Fall 1999|9/1/1999|Classics|\N|Rediscovering Civil War Classics|Plume/Penguin-Putnam|0000-00-00|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N

As deeply principled as he was pragmatic, Lincoln hated slavery, had always done so, and he understood that the slavery issue was the main cause of the War. But to retain his bipartisan war effort and the loyalty of the border slave states, Lincoln initially insisted that his sole purpose was to preserve the Union. He expected Britain and France, with their anti-slavery sensibilities, to understand that slavery was indeed the great issue in the contest and to refrain from intervention.<p>Yet with Washington and Richmond both downplaying slavery, British and French leaders felt free to act on self-interest. Driven by their need for cotton and a desire to curtail the United States, the two governments granted the Confederacy belligerent status and stood prepared, should the Confederacy prove itself invincible, to recognize it as a nation.<p>Such recognition, of course, would have been a catastrophe to the Union. As a member of the family of nations, the Confederacy would have been able to form alliances with the European powers, which might well have led to their direct involvement in the conflict. Had that happened, Jones writes, the Confederacy would have won the War.<p>Lincoln understood the danger. Determined to keep Britain and France out of the War, to remove its cause, and to forge a better Union, Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, announcing that on January 1, 1863, the eradication of slavery would become a Union war objective. But, as Jones shows, Lincoln's proclamation, instead of keeping Britain and France at bay, had the opposite effect. <p>Fearful that emancipation would provoke a slave uprising and lead to a wider war that imperiled Europe, the two countries came perilously close in the autumn of 1862 to a joint offer of mediation and \""de facto recognition\"" of Confederate nationhood. It was, Jones asserts, the Union's greatest foreign crisis in the War. But it took place \""in the private chambers of Paris and London\"" and was \""all unbeknown to American dignitaries\"" there and in Washington. The crisis passed, however, when 1863 came, no slave revolt had occurred, and Lincoln issued his final Emancipation Proclamation, which imposed an \""inescapable moral tone\"" on the War.<p>After that, the London government not only \""dropped all official talk of intervention,\"" but also emphatically rejected a motion for recognition in the House of Commons. Any lingering notions of British intervention died with the Union's great victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg and with Lincoln's immortal address at Gettysburg, which, as Jones says, was \""so critical to defining the war's higher purpose.\""<p>Meanwhile, French Emperor Napoleon III resolved to act alone in recognizing the Confederacy because his Grand Plan to establish monarchical rule and a new French empire in the Americas depended on an independent Confederacy. But Union Secretary of State Seward's repeated warning that intervention meant war with the French government forced the emperor to abandon his schemes regarding the Confederacy. By 1864, Jones states, \""the possibility of foreign intervention in the war had ceased to exist,\"" and the Confederacy stood alone, unrecognized and doomed.<p>There are two problems I might note. Jones persistently refers to the Confederacy as \""the South,\"" which is inaccurate, given that one southern state, Kentucky, and three other slave states remained in the Union. Jones also faults most studies of the Civil War for \""dwelling on battles and personalities.\"" By his own account, however, the War's crucial battles and the actions of the powerful personalities involved largely determined the course of diplomatic events.

2049|195055446|\N|The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the Onset of the Civil War|Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the Onset of the Civil War The|Holt, Michael F.|\N|\N|"If collapse of the Whig party caused the Civil War, were Whigs themselves to blame? Michl Holt, Langbourne M. Williams Professor of American History and chairman of the history department at the University of Virginia, has written a monumental and superb study. The tome is richly detailed and written in lucid prose, supplemented by tables showing key vote returns. Holt's chronological narrative consists of some 1,000 pages, plus another 250 or so containing source notes and bibliography. The result of 20 years' work, <B>The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party</B> is by far the most comprehensive account of the Whig party ever written and is perhaps the single most essential reference today for research into American antebellum politics.<p>The dialectical relationship between American political parties was arguably never so important to any political party as it was to Whigs during the second party system, circa 1834-54. Indeed, a central argument that runs through Holt's book is that Democrats profoundly influenced the fortunes of the Whig party. The Whig party took root when it carved out distinctive positions vis-a-vis the Democrats and later foundered when substantive differences -- real and perceived -- diminished after 1848. Whigs' common determination to oppose the Democrats (to defeat them in elections and to oppose their governance) held them together. Hence conflict with the Democrats was the chief centripetal force against which manifold centrifugal forces were arrayed: personal ambitions, fierce factional rivalries, and struggles over patronage.<p>Ideas have consequences<p>Tension was always there. Without balance applied by strong negative reference to Democrats, the Whig party would (and ultimately did) pull apart. Moreover, Whig and non-Whig leaders -- not voters or \society\"" or other impersonal forces -- made critical decisions that proved catastrophic, notwithstanding the strained, dynamic political environment born of sectional controversy. Whigs conceivably suffered from a problem endemic to conservative parties. They wind up holding the caboose, trying to slow down the train, as liberal parties take the initiative. In point of fact, Whigs had a well-defined conservative program, as well as articulate spokesmen to plead their case, including Henry Clay of Kentucky and Daniel Webster of Massachusetts.<p>The ideational basis for Whiggery was a nationalistic Jeffersonian economic agenda, codified into the so-called American System: high protective tariffs to nourish domestic manufacturing; a national bank to promote credit and sound currency; and internal improvements launched and financed by the federal government to improve infrastructure and to enhance the movement of people and goods. Whigs also railed against executive tyranny and preferred leadership by congressional consensus or compromise to that of chief executives and direct populist appeal. Whigs prided themselves on being constitutional unionists in the Madisonian tradition, who sought to preserve the Revolutionary generation's experiment in republican self-government through clean, honest (albeit activist) government and non-interventionist foreign policy.<p>Holt acknowledges the distinctive ideology of the Whig party but does not emphasize it overall. Whereas the Whigs viewed their ideology as timeless and permanent, however, Holt's central argument maintains that Whigs adapted ideology readily to changing times, in order to survive by striking a counterpoise to Democrats.<p>Party politics along a parabola<p>The Panic of 1837 and its aftermath and the annexation of Texas and subsequent war with Mexico (1846-48) -- gave salience to the Whigs' ideology and economic program. The prosperity after 1848 based on California gold strikes and foreign investment changed that appeal; moreover, land acquired from Mexico engendered domestic political conflict over the extension of slavery, the Compromise of 1850 notwithstanding. Mass immigration posed another challenge by the 1850sto Whigs in particular, since immigrants usually supported Democrats. Hypothesized Slave Power and Papal conspiracies mobilized huge and sometimes overlapping constituencies which threatened to rend or displace established political parties.<p>In the presidential race of 1844, Whigs were never more unified, and differences with Democrats were never sharper. Holt considers that year to have been a relative apogee for the Whig party in terms of optimal measure between cohesive and divisive forces. Indeed, the parabolic path of the Whig party from 1834-54 (with fluctuations between) attests to cyclic political fortune. Reasons for the party's birth, heyday, and death actually inhere in the same dynamics. The difference between 1834 and 1854, however, prevents the Whig phoenix from rising after 1854. To wit, the Know Nothing and Republican parties were positioned by then to siphon voters, and the new parties found compelling ways to usurp the Whig party's original ideological mission of saving republican liberty.<p>Practical success of the Whig party, as well as the legitimacy of policies based on any real consensus or compromise, depended on statehouses and state legislatures, in addition to Congress, administrations, and relations between national and state level parties and governments. These aspects interest Holt far more than ideology per se. Since state elections ran throughout the year almost every year, instead of in November of even-numbered years as they do today, Whig leaders read election results like polls to help them gauge public opinion and assess their political capital. They did not always do it very well.<p>Whigs certainly made their share of mistakes, which encouraged the dissolution of the Whig party. Desiring to ride new coalitions to victory in later elections, Whig presidents and vice presidents made wanton overtures to factions. Tyler courted Democrats and Southerners to sideline Clay. Taylor squandered significant opportunity by attempting to build an ill-conceived Taylor Republican vehicle. Fillmore obsessed over New York rival William H. Seward, but he was also jealous of fellow conservative Webster. Fillmore also misread political events and failed to move Whigs into a viable, bisectional Union party after Winfield Scott bungled his campaign in 1852. Then again, subsequent events hampered Whig recovery from that election debacle.<p>And there's the rub. Democrats made decisions too, and their decisions made effective counterpoise difficult. Democrats may have been better politicians. They certainly seemed to outflank Whigs on issues most of the time. Democrats also ran effective political machines, especially in immigrant communities. <p>There was one Democratic miscalculation, however, that made counterpoise next to impossible for the Whig party. Stephen Douglas introduced the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854. Its passage \""repealed\"" the Missouri Compromise and opened land to slavery that had been set aside for free soil. The resulting row led to \""Bleeding Kansas\"" and \""Bleeding Sumner\"" (and splintered the Know Nothing party). Had Southern Whigs resisted the temptation to support the Nebraska Act, the Whig party might still have been saved and sectional realignment forestalled.<p>Like old soldiers, however, Whigs seemed to \""just fade away\"" after 1852. Notwithstanding the death throes of state parties and delusional schemes by a few leaders, Whigs lacked the necessary temperament for a \""Come-Back Kid\"" scenario. In many ways, the classic Whig temperament was averse to hurly-burly politics and to grassroots enthusiasms. In terms of political adroitness, moreover, Holt says Whigs lacked hard-headed realism and were frequently inept or inflexible -- never able to seize decisive moments. Whigs were temperamentally overcautious, slow to respond, and disdainful. Such habits of mind applied to wealthier Whigs with a privileged social background. Less intuitively, they also applied to self-consciously sober, church-going, middle-class folk, who formed the party's base. This temperament may have made Whig constituencies more vulnerable than Democratic constituencies to incursions by competing parties, whose members had few reservations.<p><I>Wesley Allen Riddle is fellow at the National Humanities Institute and author of recent essays on the Whig party in </I>Humanitas."""|Riddle, Wesley Allen|Fall 1999|9/1/1999|Review|Antebellum politics and the collapse of compromise|Whig history|Oxford University Press|0000-00-00|Politics|\N|\N|\N|\N

As it turned out, I was the one who was mistaken.<p>Having been an infantry reenactor since the mid-'70s, I was confident that I pretty much \knew it all.\"" So I was surprised at what I found within the pages of R.

A person or small group of people wishing to take up the hobby can do it using just the information presented in <B>Reliving the Civil War.</B><p>There is nothing lacking here. The section on \""Reenactment for Infantry\"" covers the usual items -- from uniforms and equipment to tobacco, medals, and military courtesy. \""Camp Life\"" includes not just the military camp, but also civilian, sutler, and support camps. Hadden does not avoid touchy issues such as women in uniform. And he discusses rationally, unlike others I have heard, the different groups within the reenactment community. <p>The issues between casual reenactors and the hard-core \""authentics\"" are addressed appropriately.Other chapters are devoted to \""Reenacting Etiquette,\"" \""Health and Comfort\"" (remember it is <I>living</I> history, folks!), and \""Hosting a Civil War Reenactment.\""<p>The second edition includes expanded coverage of trends within the reenactment community, including roles for men, women, and children (yes, gentlemen, women do have a role in reenactments!), updated appendices (including Web site and e-mail addresses), and a new index with subject headings.<p><B>Reliving the Civil War</B> does an excellent job of covering the infantry, and even has a large section for civilians. It does not cover artillery or cavalry very well (but these topics would require a book of their own to do them justice). And it must be said that, compared with infantry reenactment, artillery or cavalry reenactments attract smaller numbers of reenacters and involve a lot more expense.<p>At the end of the book are nine very useful appendices, such as: \""National Park Service Safety and Standards,\"" \""Antietam National Battlefield Rifle-Musket Misfire Plan,\"" \""Reenactors and Taxes,\"" and even \""Reenacting Periodicals.\"" Each is a gem of information in itself.<p>I highly recommend <B>Reliving the Civil War</B> as a <I>must have</I> for anyone thinking of getting into reenactment, as well as for those who are already involved.<p><I>Dave Arneson first began reenacting in 1976 with the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry.

A reviewer may point out what he knows to be omissions and misinterpretations, of course, even claim superior knowledge -- but the <I>author</I>'s book is before him, not some other imagined or preferred work. That book and its author deserve the reviewer's best judgment, not the mere substitution of his own ideas.<p>At risk of violating this precept, I confess that <B>A Ruined Land</B> is not the book I expected when I opened it. The fault was in me. I was misled by the title and, not far into the text, by the epigraph to Part Two (from <I>Absalom! Absalom!</I> by William Faulkner): \It was winter soon and already soldiers were beginning to come back -- the stragglers, not all of them tramps, ruffians, but men who had risked and lost everything, suffered beyond endurance and had returned now to a ruined land, not the same men who had marched away but transformed.\""<p>This (and perhaps the memory of Faulkner's masterwork) caused me to jump to the conclusion that I would read about the <I>aftermath</I>, rather than the immediate end of the war, and to anticipate a broadly conceived description of a South laid waste, of grandees reduced to hoeing their own rows, great houses burned, fields idle and overgrown, the remains of a decimated male population struggling to survive in new and unwelcome conditions, and the depredations of carpetbaggers and Ku Kluxers alike. This was a devastated society forced to accept foreign ways and customs, its own having been demolished even as its values largely persisted -- and I expected perhaps a state-by-state survey of the economic and environmental and social destruction war had wrought below Mason's and Dixon's line, description of how victors and vanquished coped, or did not, with entirely novel situations (Negroes camped on, and refusing to move from, former masters' lands); above all, how those who had been masters and slaves reacted to a world turned upside down -- though not entirely.<p><B>An anecdotal, even chatty account</B><p>All or most of this, indeed, is in Michl Golay's superbly researched book, which is confined primarily to 1865 and 1866 with, at the end, a rather abrupt leap forward to 1876. It is not, however, the great overview I expected (an expectation Golay was under no obligation to fulfill; he was writing <I>his</I> book, not mine). Rather, it is an anecdotal, even chatty account (annoyingly sprinkled with first names of persons the reader is expected to recognize even after they have been long absent from the story) of numerous loosely connected events.<p>The book includes, for instance, William Sherman's march through Georgia and the Carolinas; the abortive \""peace\"" arranged between Sherman and Joseph E. Johnston (not after Appomattox, but after the last battle of the War in the East, at Bentonville, North Carolina); the assassination of Abraham Lincoln; the Booth manhunt and killing; and the trial and hanging of the other supposed conspirators. (During this discussion we learn a great deal not everyone will want to know about Lew Wallace, later the author of <I>Ben Hur</I> but here one of the judges in the courts-martial of the conspirators, and of Henry Wirz, the commander of the Confederate death camp at Andersonville.) The book also recounts Andrew Johnson's ill-fated \""swing around the circle\"" during the elections of 1866; the imprisonment of General Richard Ewell (an interesting but second-rank Confederate); and the Grand Review of Sherman's army along Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington after the guns were stilled.<p>In view of the grab bag nature of Golay's account, it is rather surprising, but welcome, that he dwells only lightly on the flight, capture, and imprisonment of Jefferson Davis -- a story elsewhere told all too often -- and on the impeachment and acquittal of Andrew Johnson, events now familiar to the modern reader owing to the ordeals of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Actually, about as much of Golay's story takes place in Washington or the North or in the Union army as in the ruined land of the title.<p>That ruination -- real, terrible, and more enduring than non-Southerners may realize -- is described mostly in the author's chosen anecdotal method, through the stories of numerous defeated and dispossessed but often defiant Southerners -- LeContes, Manigaults, Elliotts, and of course Wade Hampton, without whom no account of \""redemption\"" would be acceptable.<p>Golay devotes much attention, in fact, to Hampton's virtual fief -- South Carolina -- which was not only the fire-eating leader of secession among the Confederate states, but also the state that first underwent \""reconstruction\"" efforts because the Union conquered its coastal lowlands in the first year of the War. But was South Carolina necessarily more interesting as a war-ruined land than, say, Mississippi or Tennessee? Golay points out, almost in passing, that Georgia was \""redeemed\"" (by Democrats, from a so-called \""carpetbag government\"") more quickly than was South Carolina, but he does not tell us why or how.<p>After a relatively slow start, <B>A Ruined Land</B> is consistently interesting and usually even-handed, though it is not hard to see that Golay has a more instinctive sympathy for the often-obstreperous freedmen than for those who only reluctantly yielded ownership of slaves (as late as the South Carolina constitutional convention in burned-over Columbia in 1866, with the Confederacy defeated and readmission to the Union at stake, some delegates actively opposed the abolition of slavery!). And it may well be that the sweeping overview of a \""ruined land\"" that I expected actually is as familiar a story -- at least to Michl Golay -- as that of Jeff Davis in flight or Andrew Johnson on trial, while the personal and family histories that Golay scatters through his book are fresh and more telling of the Southern experience of defeat than any conventional history.<p>Failure in battle is unique in our history. Defeat in Vietnam was devastating -- but far away and impersonal, except to the relative few who suffered direct loss. In fact, no Americans other than the white Southerners who survived the Civil War suffered military defeat so complete, social upheaval so widespread, economic reversal so disastrous, and environmental destruction so devastating. One of the childhood sights graven in my memory is the ruined stone walls of a factory burned by Sherman's bummers, and I often heard how my grandmother picked up kernels of corn from the ground where a Yankee cavalry horse had dropped them -- her family had nothing else to eat. All Southerners of my generation, and some even younger, have heard and seen such things -- often more horrendous.<p>That is perhaps the primary reason why the South is \""different.\"" Southerners have known defeat -- if not personally, then in the blood. <B>A Ruined Land</B> -- despite some none-too-relevant divergences and a chronology sometimes difficult to follow, and perhaps because of its focus on individuals and their stories -- lends that fundamental Southern fact the immediacy and reality of endured experience. We can sense, in Michl Golay's telling, the terror and disbelief caused by the burning of Columbia, the weariness, hunger, and despair signaling a lost war and a shattered life, and the helpless anger of people whose values (profound, if wrong-headed) were scorned, and whose true home -- the land of the heart -- was as ruined as their cotton fields.<p><I>Tom G.

2221|823219348|\N|The Freedmen's Bureau and Reconstruction: Reconsiderations|Freedmen's Bureau and Reconstruction: Reconsiderations The|Cimbala, Paul A.|Miller, Randall M.|\N|"From July to October 1865, Union Major General Carl Schurz toured the South from Charleston to New Orleans. He inspected a region defeated in war and living amidst appalling physical destruction. Everywhere, he observed a breakdown in law and order and a population close to chaos.<p>Amongst the newly freed, Schurz saw fear, want, and a people whose primary help had to come from the Union forces. Amongst the white population, he noted resentment of the Union army, distaste for the freed people, little loyalty to the United States, and a universal belief that the newly freed would work only under compulsion. While whites grudgingly agreed that the individual black people no longer belonged to individual white people, they believed that black people, in general, still belonged to white people, in general.<p>In this environment the Freedmen's Bureau was expected to educate the newly freed, find them land (and often, work), guarantee their suffrage, establish them in a secure civil status as free persons in a reconstructed society, and do all these things to the satisfaction of both races and both regions in five years.<p>Paul Cimbala and Randall Miller have collected 13 essays in a volume designed to reevaluate the activities of the Bureau, its relative success and failure, its role in Reconstruction, and the social and political context in which it worked. An afterword by James McPherson provides a general reflection upon the Freedmen's Bureau, serving as a counterpoint to essays dealing with more specific aspects of its work.<p>The articles range widely over political and social issues. Two of them deal with the role of President Johnson and General Grant in Bureau affairs, while another examines the role of the Freedmen's Bureau in education in post-emancipation Maryland, which was a Northern state for purposes of war and a Southern state for purposes of slavery. The rest of the contributions cover the South from Virginia to the western frontier of slavery in Texas and Arkansas. Based solidly upon archival research, the essays examine both the day-to-day work of the Bureau and the ideals that animated it. Collectively, they describe the Freedmen's Bureau as a local agency and a national institution, as both an arm of evangelical Protestant idealism and social casework in the trenches.<p>Generally the articles agree on the main problems the Freedmen's Bureau faced. Some were internal, particularly insufficient funding and an inadequate organizational framework. Other problems involved constant presidential hostility and the often-uncertain relationships with the army and civil authorities. Most, however, stemmed from the unrelenting hostility of Southern whites to the Bureau's efforts at education and free citizenship and the white population's equally persistent attempt to have the new system of free labor resemble, as closely as possible, the old system of slavery.<p>Common problems produced common responses by the Freedmen's Bureau, with due allowance for variations in local conditions throughout the South. Everywhere in the 11 defeated states the newly freed congregated around Union army garrisons or in towns, and they needed to be fed, clothed, and housed. The Johnson administration had no intention of becoming a welfare agency, so the Freedmen's Bureau was instructed to get the freed people off Union rations, out of town, and back to work on the plantations. President Johnson pardoned most Confederate leaders, which allowed them to retain or reclaim their pre-War land holdings, and thus little fertile land was available for apportionment to freed people under the legendary 40 acres and a mule program.<p>So the Freedmen's Bureau became primarily an agency of provision, of resettlement, and of policing labor contracts to prevent the imposition of virtual slavery upon the newly freed. Needs of the moment overcame longer range plans for education and full political citizenship. The Freedmen's Bureau, of necessity, functioned as a paternalistic agency, more involved in giving care than in preparing people to care for themselves, and operating as an advocate and mediator for the weak.<p>This is an excellent book, one that every historian interested in Reconstruction should consult. It is also an important book, not merely because it addresses an important topic, but because it deals with that topic in a thoughtful and judicious manner. Buttressed by substantial research, the contributors place the Freedmen's Bureau in its mixed context of great hope and promise amidst equally great destruction and resentment. They present a balanced assessment of ideals and results, concisely summed up by James McPherson in his afterword: \If the result fell short of entire success, the alternative might well have been total failure.\""<p><I>James D.

2281|\N|\N|INTERVIEW:<P>Warrior Women--Soldiers of the Civil War: <br>An interview with DeAnne Blanton and Lauren Cook Burgess|\N|Jewett, Leah W.|\N|\N|"<br><b><i>cwbr: You have a book planned with Louisiana State University Press. Do you have a working title?</i></b> <P><B>DeAnne Blanton and Lauren Cook Burgess:</B> Yes. Because we have found instances of women in military service and engaging in battle throughout all four years of the Civil War, our working title is From Bull Run to Bentonville: Women Soldiers of the American Civil War. We hope that it will be available, appropriately, on the eve of the new millennium, sometime in 2001.<P><B><i>cwbr: When did you first learn about the phenomenon of women soldiers in the Civil War?</I></B> <P><B>db:</b> About eight years ago, I went into the stacks of the National Archives looking for something that a researcher requested. While looking through a War Department reference collection, I found an envelope with \women soldiers - Civil War\"" written on it. It was a file dating from the early 20th century. I was fascinated. I've been independently researching Civil War soldier women ever since. <P><B>lcb:</b> My curiosity about women soldiers grew out of my interest in the life of the common soldier of the Civil War. Over a decade ago, I was reading a number of soldier letters and diaries, as well as classics such as The Life of Billy Yank and The Life of Johnny Reb. I came across several references to women found in the ranks, and was immediately intrigued and fascinated. Researching these women has been an obsession for me ever since. <P><B><I>cwbr: When did you begin working together? How do you divide the research and writing responsibilities?</I></B> <P><b>lcb: </b>I first met DeAnne at the National Archives while working on the Sarah Rosetta Wakeman letters in 1992. As an archivist in 19th Century Military Reference, DeAnne was not only incredibly helpful with the Wakeman research, but she also had amassed quite a bit of information about female soldiers. Our collaboration began right then and there, sharing our lists of sources on soldier women. It wasn't too long after we met that DeAnne proposed that we work together on a history of these extraordinary women and since then we've been working toward that goal. <P><B>db:</b> Lauren and I divided up the research and went to work. Periodically over the years, we've gotten together to share our findings, and talk about what we were learning about Civil War women soldiers. When the time came to write it all down, we developed an outline for the book and divided up the writing responsibilities. We edit each other's chapters, and endlessly discuss interpretations! <P><B><I>cwbr: Is there any particular historian, such as Mary Elizabeth Massey, from whom you draw inspiration? </I></B><P><B>db:</b> I think that Massey deserves much credit for her work, Bonnet Brigades, because it was one of the first \""modern\"" works that paid serious attention to women in the Civil War. However, her interpretation of women soldiers is flawed. Massey stated that they were either crazy or prostitutes. Our research disproves this. One of my goals in writing this book is to set the record straight on that account. <p.<B>lcb:</b> My ambition for years has been to write a history of the \""common\"" woman soldier after the style of Bell Wiley. Wiley's seminal works on the common Civil War soldier have been my inspiration, as have more recent books examining individual's motivations for soldiering, such as James McPherson's For Cause and Comrades. The fact that we have collected a great deal of documentation and information on over 200 women soldiers enables us to pursue a study along these lines. <P><B><I>cwbr: What kind of reception did you receive when you began your research? Had the climate changed in the late 90s when you were searching for a publisher for your book? </I></B><P><B>db & lcb:</b> We've both experienced a range of reactions to our work over the past decade. Many are intensely fascinated by these military women, a good number respond with skepticism and anger, and there is the inevitable sensationalization of the subject. As information about women Civil War soldiers has become more widely disseminated over the years (in middle grades history textbooks, for example), the controversy has diminished somewhat, but rarely do we encounter indifference to the subject. <P><B><I>cwbr: What audience do you envision for your work? </I></B><P><B>db & lcb:</b> We believe that our audience will be quite broad, encompassing Civil War scholars and enthusiasts, those interested in women's studies, and members of the general reading public whose imagination is sparked by the idea of historical women in non-traditional roles. Indeed, these were women who participated in infantry, artillery, and cavalry combat, activities that women in the U.S. armed forces are for the most part prohibited from engaging in today. <P><B><I>cwbr: Why has it taken us so long to be ready, again, to accept the idea of women fighting as men in the Civil War? </I></B><P><B>db & lcb:</b> It's interesting that you should ask that, as we are working now on the chapter that examines just this issue. The answer lies in the changing culturally defined roles for women in our society over the past two centuries, and ironically, the broadening of women's legal and economic status in the 20th century. In 19th century Victorian society, the idea of separate spheres of influence for men and for women was so indelibly entrenched that a few exceptions to the rule that women should interest themselves only in husband, home, and family carried no threat whatsoever to cultural norms. In addition, for several centuries up through the 19th, the fictional literary and even real concept of the \""Female Warrior Bold\"" was quite widespread in popular culture. <P>The 20th century has seen big changes for American women. After 72 years of protest and agitation, women finally won the vote in 1920 and had begun to make inroads in the workplace. The cultural backlash to women's expanding legal and economic power came in the 1920s with the popularization of Freudian theories about independent women being neurotic, confused, or crazy, and most likely lesbians. These ideas about independent women who pursue non-traditional careers informed most historians' views of 19th century women soldiers until recently. While society continues to make progress in this regard, cultural taboos about women in combat remain very much intact. <P><B><I>cwbr: How many cases of women disguising themselves as men and fighting have you documented? To put this in proper context, can you give an estimate of women who dressed as men before or after the War, such as Albert DJ Cashier? </I></B>db & lcb:</B> We have information and documentation about 250 women. We only know of about seven women who dressed and lived as men either prior to the War or afterward. These were women from frontier, immigrant, or agrarian backgrounds, and they did so in order to make an honest living, which was difficult for any unmarried, independent woman to do during that period. <P><B><I>cwbr: How have you gone about researching a subject that has been hidden for so long? What resources proved most helpful? How available are these sources to the general public? </I></B><P>db & lcb:</B> The answer to how we have gone about researching this subject is: very patiently and for a very long time. These women enlisted in secrecy, and for the most part, they were very successful in keeping their identities cloaked. When discovered, they would tell military authorities or the press very little about themselves. Researching them is difficult, at best. We are deeply grateful to literally several hundred people from around the world who have, over the years, heard about our research and sent us items of interest (from as far away as Antarctica and Australia). The most helpful resource in documenting women soldiers and their experiences has been the National Archives, closely followed by the U.S. Army Military History Institute at Carlisle Barracks. Plus, women soldiers are mentioned frequently in the diaries and letters that their fellow soldiers wrote during the War. Some of these are published, and others are in archival or private collections around the country. <P><B><I>cwbr: Sarah Morgan of Louisiana often laments in her Civil War era diary that she was not a man and therefore could not join the fight. Rosetta Wakeman of New York donned men's clothes seemingly without hesitation. When you compare women of the time, both North and South, what do you think made one more likely than another to dress as a man? What kinds of women were MOST likely to do so? </I></B><P><B>db & lcb:</b> Women from poor, rural, and immigrant backgrounds were most likely to feel no compunction about shifting gender identity to suit their purposes, whether to serve as a soldier or to make a living wage. Many frontier women - and men - seemed to have little or no hesitation about females serving openly in the ranks. As one western soldier remarked in a letter home, \""- some of our best soldiers are of the fair sex. I am told that there are many in Missouri cavalry regiments and they lend a good hand in time of hardship.\"" <P><B><I>cwbr: Generally speaking, women soldiers did not affect the outcome of the War. So why is it important for us to acknowledge their role? </I></B><P><B>db & lcb:</b> Because they were there. We believe that the women veterans of the Civil War deserve the same honor accorded to their male comrades. Women soldiers not only faced the guns of the adversary, but they also faced the prejudices of their society. Their country did not expect them to fight, yet they did it anyway. Every single woman soldier was a willing volunteer, who went to extraordinary measures to enlist and stay in the army. We feel that such devotion to cause and country is a worthwhile story in itself. <P><B><I>cwbr: No doubt many women soldiers' stories are yet to be discovered, hidden beneath their male person in photographs and letters on public display in collections and museums around the country. Can we hope that corrective measures will take place as more information on the topic is disseminated? Would these women want to be revealed? </I></B><P><B>db & lcb:</B> Quite a few women were successful in maintaining their male masquerade throughout their terms of military service, and we only know about them because of postwar admissions and discoveries. We'll never know how many more women served and failed to make their stories known. We are sure that when this book is published many people who learn about these women for the first time will come forth with new information. In light of growing public appreciation for the role that women played in America's greatest and most bloody conflict, we are quite sure that these warrior women would take pride in having their stories told at this point in time. <P><B><I>cwbr: What do you hope to accomplish with your research? </I></B><P><B>db & lcb:</b> I hope we bring about a new appreciation for and understanding of these heretofore controversial and mysterious figures. They sacrificed and gave their \""last full measure of devotion\"" alongside their male comrades, never asking for or receiving any special favor because of their sex. <P><BR><i>DeAnne Blanton is a military archivist at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., specializing in 19th century army records, particularly those of the Civil War.</i><P><i>Lauren Cook Burgess is an independent historian and editor of </i>An Uncommon Soldier<i> (Oxford University Press, ISBN 0195102436, $10.95), the only collection of letters by a Civil War woman soldier known to exist.</I>"""|\N|Fall 1999|9/1/1999|Interview|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N

As fall approached, I saw areview published elsewhere that received the book less warmly, suggesting that it fails to acknowledgethe long-term social consequences of slavery. Deceit and defiance may be natural responses to bondage,but what happens when they persist beyond their necessity? This question lately has assumed particularsalience in regard to Russia's bumpy transition to liberal democracy. Like the newly freed slaves,Soviets were reared in circumstances that encouraged-and sometimes necessitated-lawbreaking. It is noeasy task to foster the rule of law or to restore familial harmony and work ethic where they have longbeen absent or suppressed. Such is the inheritance of collective history, which, though not chosen bythem, still profoundly affects individuals.<p>To recognize the courage required to both acknowledge and move beyond the past must not discourage itsundertaking. Were not slaves -- just as the post-serf and post-Soviet Russians -- better off as freedmen? Atlast summer's annual Deep Delta Civil War Symposium, James G. Hollandsworth, author of <I>Pretense ofGlory: The Life of General Nathaniel P. Banks</I> (Louisiana State University Press, $34.95, ISBN0807122939), told of New Hampshire captain Jonathan Johnson, who was stationed in South Louisianaduring the War. Writing home, Johnson described the freedwomen who visited the Union encampment to dowashing. When another soldier asked one of the women if she preferred working on her own to slavery,she replied unhesitatingly: \I had a great deal rather work hard and be my own mistress, for what Iearn now is my own and I can do with it as I like.\""<p><I>Beechers, Stowes, and Yankee Strangers</I> (University Press of Florida, $24.95, ISBN 0813016460),an account of Reconstruction in Florida by John T. Foster, Jr., and Sarah Whitmer Foster, captures adifferent aspect of post-slavery economics. \""Planters also turned to contracting with former slaves toresume work on their farms,\"" the authors note. \""Those planters known for being 'cruel' often foundthemselves without laborers.\"" Not only working conditions improved with the demise of the slaveeconomy; so also did the cause of human dignity. As the Louisiana washerwoman put it: \""I have workedfor a mistress as long as I want to. I want to live by myself.\""Even when reviewers cannot agree on a book's purpose, merit, or style, the testimony of those whodirectly experience history speaks for itself."""|\N|Fall 1999|9/1/1999|Editorial|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N|"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=61 alt=\Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/cwbrdefault.jpg\"">"""|\N

Then came the questions that I, a new Ph.D. with a dissertation on political history, dreaded: What time of the afternoon did Pickett's charge happen?  Or even worse: When are we going to get to Chickamauga?  </p><p>Such questions were posed by good students who wished to study the Civil War era because they liked military history.  But they aroused in me a fear that I had not covered everything of importance because I did not know enough.  So, I tried assigning a textbook.  </p><p>Unfortunately, with Civil War texts the cure is worse than the problem.  In going for coverage, one finds a marketplace full of aging, exorbitantly priced books.  James M. McPherson's <i>Ordeal by Fire</i> remains eloquent, but the book, originally published in 1982, is getting long in the tooth.  Further, the paperback version of that text costs over seventy dollars, and at 800 pages, students will have little time to read other material.  David Herbert Donald is the lead author of another popular, massive, and expensive text, and he has enjoyed a distinguished career.  Nevertheless, in spite of revisions, I do not feel comfortable assigning a work initially published by Donald's mentor, James G. Randall, seventy years ago.  Lesley Gordon, Michl Fellman, and Daniel Sutherland's This Terrible War is relatively new, differs from older works on some interpretive questions and includes primary source readings.  In spite of the differences, my students found it too expensive and lengthy.</p><p>Christopher Olsen's new book <i>The Civil War: A Hands-On History</i> offers one possible escape from the lengthy textbook.  This brief synthesis touches of the sectional crisis, the war, and Reconstruction.  It includes a selection of brief primary source documents, maps, and illustrations.  Hill and Wang has priced the hard cover at an almost-reasonable thirty dollars, and hopefully the paper version will be cheaper still.</p><p>Olsen, an associate professor of history at Indiana State University, is the author of a well-received monograph, <i>Political Culture and Secession in Mississippi: Masculinity, Honor, and the Antiparty Tradition, 1830-1860 </i>(2000).  After producing such a tightly focused book, this is a marked departure for him. His book offers sound interpretations of the various issues at hand and reads smoothly.  Wisely, he glides past some contentious issues among scholars, and does not claim that his interpretation of the period is definitive or unique.  For instance, Olsen makes the potentially controversial argument that the . . .  Second Party System of Whig and Democrat foundered initially over another potent issue of the 1850's: Nativism.  Yet he prefaces the sentence with a nod to the current consensus that slavery extension ultimately brought on the Civil War . . .   (43).  He is wise to keep the emphasis on slavery, especially since anti-immigrant fear of Catholicism and antislavery hatred of urban Democratic voters were by no means mutually exclusive.   </p><p>Olsen's work effectively handles political and military aspects of the Civil War era, and he frames the debate over slavery as the central point of contention.  Women and the home front play a strong role, but overall the book gives short shrift to cultural, intellectual, and religious history.  The author crafts a highly readable narrative, but by its very nature this project must omit much of the story.  Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Ralph Waldo Emerson are absent from the index, but few mainstream politicians or important generals are omitted.  </p><p>Specialists may quibble over fine points.  For example, Olsen often uses Southern interchangeably with Confederate.  In fact, the two terms are not at all synonymous, as so many Missourians and fugitive slaves understood.  Such confusion of terms leads Olsen to render Kentucky as a Northern state.  Minor errors of fact creep in only rarely, most noticeably when Olsen confuses Jubal Early with Richard Ewell in his discussion of Gettysburg.   </p><p>Overall, however, this book is a gem.  Olsen's economy of language allows him to accomplish the impossible: he offers a readable overview of a massive field with minimal damage inflicted by his compression.  While this book offers a wonderful introduction for the general reader, it also holds great value as a teaching tool.</p><p><i>Wallace Hettle is an associate professor of history at the University of Northern Iowa.

Giunta <br><p>Originally published in 1915 as <i>The Gray and the Blue</i>, John T. Wickersham's stories about his experiences in the Confederate army during the Civil War have been edited in this new edition by Professor Kathleen Gorman. Johnnie Wickersham claimed to have joined the Confederate army in Missouri at age 14 and to have served with it until May 1865. He also stated that he received a captain's commission from General Sterling Price. Gorman acknowledges that there is no record of Wickersham as a soldier. It appears that he simply attached himself to a volunteer company in which one of his brothers served, probably a company in the 4th Missouri Infantry Regiment (later the 1st and 4th Missouri Consolidated Infantry). Due to the lack of any documentary evidence, it is unclear if he was actually present with this regiment when it surrendered. Wickersham's narrative makes it clear that for long periods of time he was detached or otherwise absent from the army.</p><p>In her introduction, Gorman says that throughout his writings, fact mingles with fiction, the line separating the two often difficult to determine (ix). A close examination of the memoir, especially when weighed against historical evidence, clearly reveals that the majority of it is fiction. Some of Wickersham's stories are patently absurd. One of the most striking of these is his account of commanding a battery of boy artillerists who fired small breechloading cannons at Union vessels on the Mississippi River. This episode is a part of a longer section where Wickersham claims that he was acting as an aide to General (actually Colonel) Colton Greene while the latter was on sick leave at a plantation in northwestern Mississippi in 1862. Greene's military records show that he was never in Mississippi, questioning the authenticity of this entire portion of the memoir.</p><p>Nevertheless, Gorman writes that she finds the fiction instructive for what it says of the need for veterans on a losing side to maintain the honor of their cause (ix). Wickersham penned his memoirs at age 69 with the encouragement of friends and family but, as he wrote, more particularly for the benefit of my ten-year-old Grandson.  Rather than falling into the category of some Lost Cause conspiracy, the stories are probably more in the vein of the desire of an old man to entertain a grandchild with tales he knew were false even though he said in his prologue that they were the true personal escapades of a boy that are known, told, retold, and discussed by all the members of the family around the fireside of your Grandfather (1).</p><p>This reviewer has seen few more poorly edited books. At times, people and places are not identified at all. There are a number of egregious historical errors in the introduction and endnotes. Several examples of such errors should suffice. Gorman writes that Wickersham fought the few remaining months with his unit and surrenders with them in New Orleans (xvi). All but a handful of these Missouri Confederates became prisoners of war at Fort Blakely, Alabama, on April 9, 1865, and did not surrender in the Crescent City. In a note, Gorman says, Most Missouri units (including the First) arrived at Shiloh immediately after the major battle there and in the next sentence states, There is confusion over whether these forces actually made it to Shiloh (146n4). If the Missourians had arrived at Shiloh shortly after the battle, they would have found there only victorious Union forces, the Confederate army having retreated from that point to Corinth, Mississippi. General Earl Van Dorn's army, which included the Missouri troops, did not reach Corinth until a week later. Finally, Gorman tells of the surrender of General Edmund Kirby Smith's Trans-Mississippi Confederate army at New Orleans and claims He returned to New Orleans [from Texas] to find he had no more troops there (151n6). None of Kirby Smith's men had ever been in the Crescent City to surrender. The only Confederates in the city were three of his subordinate generals who went there to negotiate terms.</p><p>With so much of Wickersham's account being fictitious, it really adds very little to our understanding of the life of a common soldier or of the events in which the Missouri regiments participated.</p><p>Published soldier letters have long been a valuable source of descriptions of Civil War battles, marches, and camp scenes. In <i>A Civil War Soldier of Christ and Country</i>, the reader will also find much valuable detail on life at the United States Military Academy during the first three years of the conflict. Mary Giunta has chosen what she describes as John Rogers Meigs's most important private correspondence and a selected group of his official correspondence and documents (xviii) for inclusion in the book. John was the oldest child of noted engineer and architect Montgomery C. Meigs, who rose to become Quartermaster General of the Union army during the war.</p><p>Young Meigs graduated first in his class on June 11, 1863, and received a commission as lieutenant of engineers. He had already experienced combat when he went on leave from West Point and acted as a volunteer aide to Colonel Isrl B. Richardson of the 2nd Michigan Infantry Regiment during the First Battle of Manassas. Meigs's early engineering duties occurred in Maryland and West Virginia from July to November 1863. From November 1863 until August 1864, he served as Chief Engineer of the Department of West Virginia. His last post was as Chief Engineer of the Middle Military Division and aide-de-camp to General Philip Sheridan from August 1864 until his death in October of that year. His assignments had him serving under generals Benjamin F. Kelley, William W. Averell, Franz Sigel, and David Hunter. Meigs was present at a number of battles and engagements, including Rocky Gap, Droop Mountain, Staunton, New Market, Lynchburg, Piedmont, Opequon, and Fisher's Hill.</p><p>Although most of his personal wartime letters contain rich detail on engineering operations and the movements of Union forces, Meigs rarely provided any assessment of his commanding generals. He described Averell as very kind and pleasant (192).  Of Sigel's performance at New Market, Meigs wrote that he behaved with a great deal of personal gallantry but did not manage his troops well (222). He also did not expend much ink in describing battles; his longest accounts are of New Market and Piedmont. The letters do include a number of rich nuggets of information. For example, he described the temporary defenses used by Confederate troops at Piedmont: The Rebels made strong breastworks in five minutes of fence rails, laid sloping against a fence and with chinks open everywhere. <u>Our Napoleon shell glanced from</u> these inclined shields in some instances (226). Meigs provided a wonderful description of the wounding of Brigadier General Albert T. A. Torbert at the Battle of Opeguon. He saw a Confederate soldier walk alone out into an open field, raise his rifle, and fire. Meigs heard the ball whistle through the air before hitting Torbert.</p><p>Meigs died in an encounter with Confederate soldiers near Dayton, Virginia, on October 3, 1864. His father and General Sheridan thought that this had been an ambush. Son incensed was the latter that he ordered his men to burn the town and all buildings and houses within five miles of the scene of the killing (7). The grieving father attempted to find proof of murder but failed to do so. Giunta has included an epilogue that thoroughly examines the documents collected during this investigation.

That the vast majority of veterans both North and South came directly from a society that valued and often overrated its citizen-soldier tradition is doubly significant.</p><p>Editors Larry M. Logue, Professor of History and Political Science at Mississippi College and author of <i>To Appomattox and Beyond:  The Civil War Soldier in War and Peace</i>, and Michl Barton, Professor of American Studies and Social Science at Pennsylvania State University-Harrisburg and author of <i>Goodmen: The Character of Civil War Soldiers</i>, have added much to our understanding of the American soldier's fundamental inseparability from society.  Organized into five topical units:  Transition to Peace, Problems of Readjustment, Governments Provide Aid, Veterans Fight Their Own Battles, and Veterans Shape the Collective Memory, this volume provides a broad spectrum of interpretations.  Dixon Wecter's 1944 view of war as a suppressor of the combatant's past invites reassessment by Barton and other more recent observers, even though references to Wecter's and Emory Thomas's similar view of the Confederate experience serve as a useful historiographical point of departure for readers in search of an overview or research topics of their own.  More often than not, one meets veterans whose societal and cultural baggage could not always be discarded when the uniforms were issued.  Not even the comradeship and regimentation of soldiering wielded enough power over individuals to produce a single overarching perspective, either Northern or Southern.</p><p>Writing of Jubal Early's efforts to sanctify Lee and romanticize the prewar past, for example, Gaines Foster argues that Early's essentially elitist interpretation garnered little appeal outside of Virginia, and the Virginia aristocracy at that.  Similarly, when the United Confederate Veterans supplanted the Southern Historical Society as the South's dominant veterans' group during the 1890s, its emphasis on the role of the enlisted man, his purported respect for property, and rejection of an idealized antebellum South highlighted social and geographic divides less visible in conventional Lost Cause historiography.  Rifts also existed within the Deep South.  At the 1890 Mississippi constitutional convention, Confederate veterans who controlled the franchise committee ensured black disfranchisement.  Nevertheless, notes Logue, a sharply defined split existed between the upcountry and cotton belt.  As for the Northern \soldier vote,\"" that, too, could vary according to local conditions.  Stuart McConnell uncovers a GAR chapter in Philadelphia whose wealthy membership maintained a reserved attitude toward pensions, and Logue mentions Indiana veterans who, having benefited from Democratic favoritism in pension distribution, could not necessarily be counted on to vote Republican.  Peter Blanck, Chen Song, and Donald R. Shaffer all find that pension application success rates often varied according to ethnicity, with German assimilationism, Irish nationalism and Black illiteracy surfacing as distinguishing features.  Essays by W. Fitzhugh Brundage and Richard Reid further highlight the peculiar problems faced by USCT veterans, most of who came from the South and lived there after the war.  Even within the southern black community, these Union men often found themselves subordinated to lighter skinned community leaders from Northern backgrounds.</p><p>If confronted by the absence of archetypal Union and Confederate veterans, readers in search of a common denominator will at least note their frequent reliance on agenda-driven memory, presentism, and sometimes willful deceit.  In Patrick J. Kelly's study, we see Benjamin Butler covering up segregation in soldiers' homes in a report to Congress.  Foster notes that respect for private property, a trait which the United Confederate Veterans attributed to their former selves, was an 1890s value rather than an 1860s one, while McConnell depicts a GAR whose lack of interest in social and political change during the nineties was much more in line with American popular opinion of three decades earlier.</p><p>For history students in search of well-documented historical parallels, this volume offers the greatest dividends.  Eric T. Dean, Jr. finds that Civil War soldiers suffered just as surely from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as did their Vietnam Era descendants, and several contributors note both GAR and UCV pressure on textbook publishers to render skewed but politically correct histories.  And David W. Blight's commentary on a segregated Wilsonian society's view of its own past invites comparison with more recent politicians who also re-interpreted the sacrifices of others to their own advantage -- even when the scale of distortion was so colossal that it called for more forgetting than remembering.  In the end, popularized collective perceptions past or present reveal more about the perceivers.</p><p><i>The Civil War Veteran</i> is excellent social history from the rank and file up and should find its way onto numerous Reconstruction and the New South course reading lists.  The notes and concluding bibliographic essay alone make it worth owning.</p><p><i>John Daley is Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of History at Pittsburg State University in southeastern Kansas.</i>"""|Daley, John|Summer 2007|8/1/2007|Review|\N|\N|New York University Press|\N|Biographies;Common;Military|\N|\N|"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=242 alt=\Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/TheCivilWarVeteran.jpg\"">"""|\N
3773|9780810000000|$34.95 hardcover|Civil War Petersburg: Confederate City in the Crucible of Civil War|\N|Greene, A. Wilson|\N|\N|<h3>Petersburg, Virginia: A City Under Siege</h3><br><p>A. Wilson Greene, Executive Director of Pamplin Historical Park and the National Museum of the Civil War Soldier, has written a well-researched and extensive community study of Petersburg, Virginia, the Cockade City.  Petersburg's importance as a logistical and transportation hub for Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia led to a virtual, if still somewhat porous, siege conducted by Ulysses S. Grant's armies between June 1864 and April 1865.  During that campaign, Grant aimed at severing the Army of Northern Virginia's and Richmond's communications with the rest of the Confederacy, most of which passed through Petersburg.  Grant gradually extended the Federal left from initial positions to the east of the Cockade City south and west to put his troops astride various railroads and roadways that fanned out along the city's southern arc.  Grant's eventual success in this effort forced Lee's evacuation of Richmond and Petersburg, which in turn led to the surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox, arguably the effective end of significant Civil War military operations.</p><p>The military story of Petersburg's siege and fall is familiar to most Civil War historians, and one that has been ably chronicled in such works as Richard J. Sommers' <i>Richmond Redeemed: The Siege at Petersburg</i> (1981) and Noah Andre Trudeau's <i>The Last Citadel: Petersburg, Virginia, June 1864-April 1865 </i>(1991), but Greene's work is a true social history of the city that includes its entire wartime experience.  While Greene does cover in some degree the military campaigns that affected Petersburg, both major and minor, the focus is on the city itself, and the work should thus be seen in historiographical terms as a community study akin to Martin Crawford's <i>Ashe County's Civil War: Community and Society in the Appalachian South</i> (2001), Daniel E. Sutherland's <i>Seasons of War: The Ordeal of a Confederate Community</i> (1995), J. Matthew Gallman's <i>Mastering Wartime: A Social History of Philadelphia During the Civil War</i> (1990), and Theodore J. Karamanski's <i>Rally Round the Flag: Chicago and the Civil War</i> (1993).  Long ago, indeed, does Maris Vinovskis's 1990 lament on social historians' neglect of the Civil War now seem, with the veritable explosion of work on the topic in the last decade and a half.  Greene's work is thorough in its research, with a prodigious bibliography filled with printed and manuscript sources on his topic, and the study's overall organization works well, sometimes moving back and forth between civilian and military perspectives.  Thankfully, Greene and the University of Virginia Press provided adequate maps for the task at hand.</p><p>However, as competently done a study as it is, some readers, especially academic historians, might desire a sharper historiographical angle on Petersburg's relevance.  This is perhaps especially pertinent in the wake of Edward L. Ayers's recent <i>In the Presence of Mine Enemies: War in the Heart of America, 1859-1863</i> (2003), which goes beyond the usual confines of the tightly focused and researched community study by comparing two different communities, North and South, and then using the comparison to address broader questions of contingency, causation, and historical method.  Furthermore, one of Petersburg's more interesting demographic characteristics?that in 1860, 26 percent of free persons in the city were African-American?might have been a topic better developed during the work's wartime chapters.  Greene does cover frictions between whites and blacks during the war, and the Confederate government's use of African-American labor for military purposes, but what at first glance appears to be an especially distinctive racial dynamic in the city might have received further and more extensive treatment.  Petersburg is, of course, an interesting topic in itself, and while Greene is free to avoid the sometimes stifling shackles of academic historiography, such a perspective might have been fruitful, especially in a study published by a university press and fully in line with professional standards of research and documentation.  These comments are relative quibbles, however; any book is properly the possession of its author, not its reviewers, and taken on its own terms, Greene has made a worthy contribution to our growing body of knowledge on Civil War social history.</p><p><i>Dr. Wayne Wei-siang Hsieh is an assistant professor of history at the United States Naval Academy.

Gray's interpretation was eventually challenged, most prominently Frank Klement of Marquette University, who devoted his entire scholarly life to proving that the Copperhead menace in the Midwest was really a fantasy promoted by partisan Republicans.  To readers with no stake in this scholarly quarrel, it seemed that the truth probably lay somewhere in between.  But for decades, no one was willing to attempt a new history of the Copperheads.  A number of excellent books and articles on dissent in the North have appeared in recent years, but these narrowly focused studies left students of the Civil War yearning for a definitive synthesis.  </p><p>In many ways, Weber succeeds in delivering the modern, insightful study of the Copperheads that has been so long overdue.  Weber states that there were four kinds of Copperheads and three phases to their movement.  The four groups she identifies as most likely to become Copperheads were immigrants, strict constructionists, those who opposed emancipation, and those with familial or business ties to the South.  The first phase of the movement, she argues, began with secession; emancipation brought many new adherents, while the bleak summer of 1864 proved to be, in Weber's view, the high-water mark of Copperhead popularity.  Northern military victories late that summer doomed Copperhead efforts to stop the war and negotiate a settlement to the sectional conflict.  Lincoln's victory in the 1864 presidential election committed the nation to fighting until the South surrendered unconditionally, thus dooming the Copperhead goal of maintaining the Union as it was and the Constitution as it is.</p><p><i>Copperheads</i> is extremely well written and never overloads the reader with superfluous facts or details, as do so many books that developed from doctoral dissertations.  Anyone who thinks that professional historians today can only produce jargon-laden tomes irrelevant to those outside of academia will think again once they read Weber's engaging prose.  Another strength of Weber's book is her use of soldiers' correspondence to help illuminate the impact of the Copperhead movement.  These letters lead to her most original finding?that news of Copperhead activity, when it reached soldiers, helped to abolitionize the troops (102).  Weber contends convincingly that reports of Copperhead speeches did not motivate many soldiers to desert, as Republicans feared and Confederates hoped.  Instead, Copperheadism actually made troops <i>more</i> determined than ever to carry on, so that their sacrifices and those of their fallen comrades would not have been in vain.  </p><p>While that finding is an important one, Weber's study ultimately leaves the reader disappointed.  Part of the problem is that Weber never clearly defines what a Copperhead is.  Republicans commonly used the term to describe those who did not support the war or even those who merely complained about the Lincoln administration's handling of it.  Weber seems to uncritically accept this Republican definition. </p> <p>During the war, however, the term Copperhead carried far more sinister connotations than did Peace Democrat, the term Weber uses interchangeably with Copperhead.  Contemporaries did not generally use the term Copperhead to describe men like Ohio Congressman Samuel Sunset Cox, who appeared to be a reasonable, principled opponent to some aspects of using military means to end the sectional conflict.  All but the most blatant partisans instead generally reserved the Copperhead label for those perceived to be <i>actively</i> aiding and abetting the Confederacy.  These were men such as New York Mayor Fernando Wood, who proposed that the city secede from the Union, or New York editor James McMaster, who in addition to publishing (until he was jailed) a virulently anti-war newspaper, also helped Confederate spies in their efforts to disrupt the 1864 presidential election.  Any Democrat might say that the draft was foolish or unfair, but only a Copperhead would advise men to actively resist its implementation.</p><p>Weber's failure to differentiate between the Coxes and McMasters in her story may relate to her book's origin as a dissertation entitled The Divided States of America: Dissent in the North during the Civil War.  Despite its new title, Weber's book is still about dissent in general, not Copperheadism, which was a particular, extreme form of Civil War dissent.  By choosing to change the title to <i>Copperheads</i>, Weber had a responsibility to more fully examine what it meant to be one and why some Northerners crossed the line from criticism to active resistance, while others did not.  Readers looking to have such questions answered will find <i>Copperheads</i> disappointing. </p><p>Weber's book is thus particularly weak in analyzing the motivations of her subjects.  She notes that some Northerners became Copperheads because of their dedication to Jeffersonian notions of strict construction of the Constitution (4, 18-19).  But anyone familiar with the Louisiana Purchase knows that even the strictest of strict constructionists might bend his principles in unusual circumstances.  It seems just as likely that many Copperheads who cited constitutional scruples as their motivation to oppose fighting the South were really driven more by a racist opposition to the inevitable improvement in the status of African Americans that a northern victory would bring.  The Copperheads' complex motivations demand serious attention, but Weber merely lists them in several paragraphs rather than analyzing them in a sustained manner.</p><p><i>Copperheads</i> also lacks sufficient detail on many of the key events in the Copperhead story.  Late in the summer of 1861, the Lincoln administration began an effort, under the supervision of Secretary of State William Seward, to suppress Copperhead newspapers.  Journals across the country were shut down as a result of this effort; a handful of editors were even jailed until they signed pledges of allegiance to the federal government and the Constitution.  The closures brought the issue of Copperheadism to the forefront of public attention and prompted a fascinating debate on the extent to which public criticism of the government should be permitted during a civil war.  </p><p>Yet this important episode in the Copperhead story merits just half a paragraph in Weber's book (36) and she mentions only New York even though the suppression of the Copperhead press took place nationwide.  There is far more detail about this key event in Allan Nevins's fifty year-old <i>War for the Union</i> than in Weber's history of the Copperheads.  Worse still, neither her footnotes nor her bibliography cite the scholarly articles written specifically about the New York newspaper closures she describes.  Nor does she cite the easily accessible primary sources on these arrests published in the <i>Official Records</i> of the war.  Her bibliography lists an article on seventeenth and eighteenth-century revolutionary settlements and a book on Florentine political thought, but not a single work on Fernando and Benjamin Wood, two of the most infamous Copperheads in the nation (and the latter one of the New York editors whose papers were closed).  The author of a history of the Copperheads must bring such scholarship to the attention of her readers.</p><p>Weber's book also offers frustratingly brief accounts of the Copperhead secret societies.  Because she argues at the outset of her book that Klement underestimated their importance, the reader expects a detailed account of their operations to substantiate her assertion.  But the reader is given only a couple of isolated examples and little sense of the scale of the societies' efforts.  She tantalizingly states that federal and state files are filled with records that contradict Klement's interpretation (53), but does not direct readers to those files or explain why she interprets those records so much differently than Klement did.  </p><p>As I finished <i>Copperheads</i>, I still did not know her protagonists as intimately as I should have.  The book contains many more quotations of northern soldiers giving their opinions about the Copperheads than it does quotations of the Copperheads themselves.  We are never told what a single Copperhead did before the war or after it.  So while Weber's book is now the first place I will send my own students who seek to know more about northern dissent and its impact on the war, the definitive history of the Copperheads remains to be written. </p><p><i>Tyler Anbinder is professor of history and chair of the Department of History at George Washington University.

3775|9781580000000|$35.00 hardcover|Harvard's Civil War: A History of the Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|\N|Miller, Richard F.|\N|\N|<h3>Ivy League Regiment</h3><br><h3>The Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry</h3><p>No Union regiment in the Civil War embodied the perception of an Eastern elite better than the Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry.  Its original officers were predominantly students and alumni of Harvard, or their social equals, the sons of Boston's first families?men who believed it was their inherent right and responsibility to lead, whether in business, society, or war.  They made no secret of their social superiority, and tried (in vain) to restrict the regiment's officer corps?or at least its field and staff?to gentlemen.  These were the bright lights of their generation, including such blue-bloods as Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., his close friend Penrose Hallowell, Francis Winthrop Palfrey, Casper Crowninshield, Henry Abbott, James Jackson Lowell, Charles E. Cabot, Henry Ropes, and William Francis Bartlett.  The Twentieth Massachusetts won glory at a terrible price but lived up to the high expectations set for it, as Richard F. Miller demonstrates in his elegant and masterful regimental history, <i>Harvard's Civil War</i>.</p><p>If most of the officers were gentlemen, the nucleus of the regiment, Miller states, consisted of four very non-gentlemanly companies: two of first and second-generation German-Americans, one of Irish, and one of Boston street toughs.  Another company featured a contingent of Nantucket men, many of them sailors.  Factions based on class and ethnicity quickly developed, yet the abolition of slavery defined the dispute between factions most clearly.  Many of the gentlemen officers strongly opposed abolition, while the Germans and other enlisted men favored it, along with a devoted faction of officers supported by Massachusetts governor John Andrew.  The task of molding these men into a cohesive fighting unit fell to its popular colonel, William Raymond Lee, an 1829 West Point graduate from one of the Boston area's first families, who was aligned with the abolitionists.  Lee gained the respect of men and officers on both sides of the question, and forged a compact, as Miller styles it, to keep the peace among competing interests within the regiment.  But circumstances interfered with the compact: Lee and most of the abolitionist officers were wounded, captured, or killed in the battle of Ball's Bluff in October, 1861.  Lee's further absences and his eventual resignation late in 1862 kept the regiment in a state of continuing strife.</p><p>Internal strife had to be laid aside, for the most part, when the regiment marched into battle.  From the disaster at Ball's Bluff to the final assault on Petersburg in April, 1865, the Twentieth fought in most of the major battles in the East.  It quickly gained a reputation for its toughness and for individual acts of bravery.  Miller skillfully describes the battles and campaigns in which the Twentieth played a part, illuminating with personal accounts the familiar story of the Army of the Potomac and the less familiar part played by the Twentieth.  As with other regiments hardened by the first year of war, the Twentieth was often put in the vanguard of attack.  It led the street-by-street fighting in Fredericksburg in December, 1862, under murderous fire, stood near the point of the furthest Confederate advance at Gettysburg on July 3, 1863, and seemed to be in the thick of every battle in Grant's Overland Campaign in the spring of 1864.</p><p.Army regulations nearly forced the regiment to disband for want of troops before Grant launched his campaign.  Colonel George Nelson Macy (a Nantucketer who, despite his strong anti-abolition views eventually won Governor Andrews's endorsement) resorted to recruiting freshly arrived immigrants, mostly Germans.  Even with his aggressive recruiting, the 813 men on the regiment's muster roll at the start of May, 1864, were reduced to fewer than 200 by late June.  To add insult to injury, much of the remainder was captured at Reams' Station on August 25, leaving the regiment with 73 men.  Although the Twentieth retained regimental status and continued to fight, its meaningful history ended at Reams' Station.  None of the Harvard officers remained, and by war's end only forty-four original recruits remained in the ranks.</p><p><i>Harvard's Civil War</i> is the second full-length history of the Twentieth; the first, George Anson Bruce's <i>The Twentieth Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry</i>, was published in 1906.  Miller has used sources unavailable to Bruce, and some?notably the accounts of enlisted men collected by historian John Codman Ropes (whose brother Henry was mortally wounded at Gettysburg in the service of the Twentieth)?that Bruce omitted.  A bibliographic essay summarizes the most important primary sources the author consulted, but a complete bibliography would have been useful.  Miller's thorough endnotes, occupying seventy pages, provide much useful information and expand on points made in the text.  Names are well-represented in the index, but it falls short on subjects?there are no entries, for instance, for abolitionism, recruitment, and morale, though these subjects show up chronologically under Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry.</p><p>Miller warmed up to the task of a regimental history by co-authoring (with Robert F. Mooney) <i>The Civil War: the Nantucket Experience, Including the Memoirs of Josiah Fitch Murphey</i> (1994).  Many of the Nantucket soldiers served in George Macy's Company I of the Twentieth Massachusetts.  <i>Harvard's Civil War</i> is undoubtedly better for Miller's earlier work on the Nantucketers, as the author brought to it a better understanding of the unit's enlisted men.  Miller has also written on more recent military topics, including <i>A Carrier at War: On Board the USS Kitty Hawk in the Iraq War</i> (2005).</p><p>Modern regimental histories often suffer from the same lack of objectivity that characterizes those written in the decades after the war.  The earlier histories were written to memorialize rather than analyze, and the large body of such works helped to form the mythology of the Civil War.  Few military units truly deserve scholarly attention, though narrative histories can be instructive and entertaining.  The Twentieth Massachusetts is a major exception; its social divisions, the trials of warfare and conscience so well documented by its members, and its importance as a symbol of the best of the Bay State make it worthy of special attention.  Richard F. Miller has succeeded in writing a scholarly and entertaining account of one of the most fabled Union regiments in the Civil War.</p><p><i>Jeffrey D.

3776|9780810000000|$24.95 hardcover|Abraham Lincoln: The Observations of John G. Nicolay and John Hay|\N|Burlingame, Michael, ed.|\N|\N|<h3>Lincoln According to his Secretaries</h3><br><p>In this slim collection a distinguished editor and biographer presents eleven brief excerpts from the ten-volume <i>Abraham Lincoln: A History</i>, by his devoted secretaries John G. Nicolay and John Hay.  The introduction, Nicolay and Hay: Court Historians, appeared in the Winter 1998 <i>Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association</i>.  Readers of that masterful summary may have no need of this book.  Burlingame displays his usual sensitivity to male relationships, comparing the affection between Lincoln and Hay to that between George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, though he errs in making Hay, an Ivy League snob, nineteen years younger than his boss; he was actually the junior by twenty-nine years.  Non-specialists are apt to be misled by much of the content of the fewer than 65 pages Burlingame has cherry picked from the mammoth biography.  Partly serialized in the <i>Century Magazine</i>, 1886-1890, and published as books in the latter year, few today, even among Lincoln specialists, have read the entire 4,709 pages.  Scholarly assessments changed almost completely from the late 1880s, when James Ford Rhodes praised it, to 1939 when Allan Nevins condemned it.  Burlingame argues that Carl Sandburg could not have begun his own life without it.  Other biographers had to rely on it until the opening of the Lincoln papers in 1947, followed two years later by the publication of Hay's diary and Nicolay's memos of presidential conversations.  Now, except for hardcore Lincoln idolaters, including the current clique of court historians, most readers will find even the brief excerpts from this panegyric hard to stomach.  The contrast between Burlingame's scholarship and Nicolay and Hay's hagiography is often jarring.   </p>   <p>The selections come from volumes three, four, five, six, and ten.  All but one of the chapters focus on the first two years of Lincoln's presidency, including the election aftermath and cabinet selections, the Sumter crisis, patronage distribution, the beleaguered capital in 1861, Bull Run, Lincoln's relations with George B. McClellan and his subsequent removal, and the 1862 cabinet crisis.  A final chapter summarizes Nicolay and Hay's assessment of Lincoln's fame two decades after his death.  They elevated their martyred president above all other mortals, partly because the blood of Virginia planters ran in his veins, a myth long since demolished. </p> <p>Robert Todd Lincoln, the president's only surviving son, had complete power to excise from the manuscript anything objectionable.  He criticized the original description of Thomas Lincoln, the president's hard luck father, demanding a more favorable cameo.  Robert Lincoln's complaints about innumerable passages caused the authors considerable difficulty.  In satisfying their patron, who controlled access to his father's papers, Nicolay and Hay destroyed much of the potential value of their work after decades of labor.</p> <p>Yet there are gems to be found even in this brief distillation.  On November 6, 1860, the day of the presidential election, an angry resident who felt that he had been libeled caned an editor in Springfield.  Some current nineteenth-century historians think that such random violence occurred only in the benighted South.  Lincoln called our national elections big boils but grabbed the largest brass ring of all.  Then the embattled president compared the office seekers who swarmed the White House daily to the last biting flies of autumn.  Since Lincoln had long been just such an office seeker, usually a disappointed one, his complaint rings false.  Either the job offered was one that he (or his wife Mary) did not want; or the job he wanted went to someone else.  It strains credulity to read of Lincoln's shock that he could not rely on his cabinet for sound advice about appointments, since they all had their own lists of personal favorites.  Partly because of this ordeal, Lincoln developed the germ of an idea for what would later be the civil service.</p><p>The editorial comment in each chapter that precedes the selection from Nicolay and Hay is often longer, and nearly always more valuable, than the excerpt itself.  But there are far too many omissions, errors, and skewed interpretations by the two secretaries for even Burlingame, with his encyclopedic knowledge of Lincoln, to correct them all.  The two acolytes were clearly wrong about countless matters as shown by scholarship since World War II.  One notable example on pages 26-27 is Lincoln's cabinet, which in weaker hands . . . would have been a hot-bed of strife; under him it became a tower of strength.  That is why he rarely consulted it before making important decisions, a complaint made by men as different as Gideon Welles and Salmon P. Chase.  Nicolay and Hay's own narrative betrays them.  They rightly damn the mendacious Chase, but also the incompetent, ethically challenged Simon Cameron (80).  Supporters like Seward and Welles (whose selection as Navy secretary was later than Burlingame thinks) are relegated to minor roles, and a number of others are barely mentioned.  That was the case even with Mary Lincoln.  Today biographers feel obliged to treat this sad, troubled woman in tiresome detail.  For gendered reasons some even make her into a co-presidential precursor of such feminist icons as Eleanor Roosevelt and Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p> <p>Of Lincoln, Burlingame claims that There was never a closer calculator of political probabilities than himself.  He was completely at home among election figures (24).  Later he notes Lincoln's mastery of Illinois politics, but does not give him sufficient credit for the political genius and cunning that he demonstrated at the national level, more akin to that of Karl Rove or James Carville than that of most presidents.  For example, Burlingame downplays the political timing of Lincoln's second firing of McClellan, which matched his removal of Benjamin Butler after his reelection in 1864.  The editor is better at noting Nicolay and Hay's flagrant bias against Chase, McClellan, and all Confederates, such as John B. Magruder, who gets a thorough drubbing, but probably helped the Union cause by resigning his commission.   Burlingame does not do as well correcting the multiple but inaccurate plaudits by Nicolay and Hay of such third raters as Irwin McDowell.  Yet he clearly knows the Civil War almost as well as he does Lincoln, quoting Montgomery Meigs on the loser at Bull Run as a good, brave, commonplace fat man.' (75).</p> <p>A chapter by chapter comparison of each of the eleven excerpts with Nicolay and Hay's original text reveals some questionable items that readers will miss since there is no note on editorial method.  Burlingame on at least ten occasions has combined two paragraphs from the biography into one, or split a single original paragraph into two.  There is no clear logic behind these changes.  Long paragraphs are left untouched; shorter ones are split; still others are combined into quite lengthy passages.  This is not a facsimile edition, and such unidentified format changes are probably not important.  More significant, the excerpt on Stanton in chapter seven is not from volume six as stated, but five, though the pagination is the same as Nicolay and Hay's.  Most editorial omissions are properly indicated by ellipsis, but some have slipped through.  On page 123 a quotation from Chase reads How singularly all our worst defeats have followed administrative blunders.  Nicolay and Hay's version of the document included er-, showing that the Treasury secretary meant to write errors, but changed it to the harsher word.</p><p>Admirers of our greatest president eagerly await the appearance of Burlingame's own multi-volume biography.  Given his special insights into Lincoln's sexual orientation, male friendships, marriage, and a host of other matters, will he present a version closer to reality, like that penned by Lincoln's law partner William Herndon, or will his Abraham be more akin to the heroic but mythical figure created by Nicolay and Hay?  In an 1856 letter to Herndon, Lincoln called biographies as generally written . . . not only misleading, but false.  Can Burlingame avoid the sentimental pieties to be found in this official biography, or will he succumb to being just another one of a long line of courtiers in Honest Abe's retinue?  If the answer proves to be the latter, what size audience will he have?  One suspects it will not be much larger than the present readership of Nicolay and Hay's monstrosity.   </p><p><i>Michl B.

Abraham Lincoln wrote the most famous speech in world history, the Gettysburg Address, which defined democracy for ordinary people. A year later he resurrected the largely forgotten example of the classical magnanimous political leader for the modern world in his phrase with malice toward none. Ironically, even fellow wordsmiths, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, failed to recognize Lincoln's talents during his lifetime, just as others often failed to appreciate his talent as the consummate democratic political leader.</p><p>To gain a window on his presidency and a key to his accomplishments, Douglas L. Wilson, co-director of the Lincoln Studies Center at Knox College and the author of the highly praised <i>Honor's Voice: The Transformation of Abraham Lincoln</i> (1998), uses his new book to focus on Lincoln's writing style. Though Wilson has little to add to how someone with a minimal elementary education could achieve eloquence, he suggests patterns in Lincoln's style that led him to emerge as a distinctly American writer.</p><p>So as to not overwhelm the reader, Wilson focuses on nine pieces of Lincoln's writing: (1) the Farewell Address at Springfield, Illinois (February 11, 1861); (2) the First Inaugural (March 4, 1861); (3) the Message to Congress in Special Session (July 4, 1861); (4) the Emancipation Proclamation (January 1, 1863); (5) the Letter to Horace Greeley (August 22, 1862); (6) the Letter to Erastus Corning and Others (June 12, 1863); (7) the Letter to James C. Conkling (August 26, 1863); (8) the Gettysburg Address (November 19, 1863); and (9) the Second Inaugural Address (March 4, 1865).</p><p>And what are the patterns? There are at least seven: (1) he wrote a lot; (2) he continually revised his speeches even after delivering them; (3) he wrote with a purpose and a particular audience in mind; (4) he continuously thought through issues, often writing ideas on scraps of paper when they occurred to him and literally putting them on file until he was ready to write in length; (5) he chose his words carefully to achieve a purpose, including trying to shape public opinion; (6) he avoided off-hand comments, preferring prepared remarks; (7) he wrote by ear and listened to the comments from others, especially William Seward, his secretary of state. These patterns often led to Lincoln's prose poetry when he was at his best. </p><p>Though the topic of this book may seem dull to many, the author makes it interesting through his own remarkable clarity as a writer.  His insights on writing provide a window into Lincoln's thinking and his determination to make America's great experiment in self-government serve as a model for the rest of the world even during a civil war. </p><p><i>William D.

3778|9780060000000|$24.95 hardcover|Mr. Lincoln's T-Mails: The Untold Story of How Abraham Lincoln Used the Telegraph to Win the Civil War|\N|Wheeler, Tom|\N|\N|<h3>Communicating in Wartime</h3><br><h3>The Telegraph and the Commander-in-Chief</h3><p>The Frank and Virginia Williams Collection of Lincolniana contains this telegram, dated September 27, 1861, from President Lincoln to his lawyer friend, Samuel T. Glover, in St. Louis, Missouri:  </p><p><blockquote>What news from up river?---Lexington, Booneville, or Jefferson City? </blockquote><blockquote>Please answer.  A. LINCOLN</blockquote></p><p>This is one of the twenty telegrams that Lincoln sent during the first year of the war though he had only seen a telegraph for the first time three years before he took office.  But by 1862, with General-in-Chief George B. McClellan sick with typhoid and the president frustrated with his lack of action on the battlefield, Lincoln had grasped the significance of the telegraph.  He used it often to seek operational control of his armies as well as intelligence, so that by the end of the war he had sent nearly 1,000 telegrams.  Though Lincoln recognized that the Union had overwhelming advantages of a more industrialized economy, larger population, extensive rail system, and the ability to resupply,  In reality, however, Wheeler writes, the Civil War was, as Wellington said of Waterloo, a damn near thing.'</p><p>The author points out how useful and essential intelligence is during wartime.  As the Duke of Marlborough said, No war can be conducted successfully without early and good intelligence.  Lincoln's evolving use of the telegraph comes as no surprise as he was one of the most technologically savvy lawyers of his time despite his education which he described as defective.  As an attorney, he took on the most complicated cases that required broad knowledge in the fields of medicine, engineering, and science.  He became the first and only president to have a patent registered to him (though it was never manufactured, Patent No. 6469 was a device to lift boats over shoals).</p><p>Nonetheless, Lincoln was the first president to use real-time electronic communications.  With his understanding of the telegraph's value, Lincoln practically lived at the telegraph office reading dispatches and sending messages.  As the author clearly demonstrates, Lincoln used the telegraph to glean information directly from the field, oversee military actions, and convey his military thinking ? strategic and tactical ? to his commanders.  Not to be understated was his use of the telegraph to mobilize political support throughout the Union, as well as control the flow of information, since the War Department seized control of the telegraph lines early in the war.  Wheeler, the CEO of high-tech companies and author of <i>Take Command!  Leadership Lessons from the Civil War</i>, is just the right person to make the comparisons between technology ? then and now.   The title of his present book cleverly captures the resemblance between yesterday's telegrams and today's e-mails.  Rapid knowledge of battlefield conditions might make a difference in modern warfare.</p><p>Yet, there are countless examples provided in this book of Lincoln's attempt to use the telegraph to direct the army and gather intelligence only to be thwarted by his generals in the field. The author discusses, at length, the contentious relationship between the President and General George B. McClellan through the use of telegrams from Lincoln in which he attempts, unsuccessfully, to prod his general-in-chief.  While Wheeler may overstate the case that the telegraph changed the war and brought it to an earlier conclusion than otherwise with this evidence, one gets the sense that if Lincoln's generals had been more forthright in their dealings with the Commander-in-Chief, the war could have been shortened.  </p><p>Of course, this changed when Ulysses S. Grant took Vicksburg, Mississippi in July 1863.   Inspired by Grant's success, the Commander-In-Chief used the telegraph in such a way that this communications network aided the destruction of the Confederate army.  Many of the telegrams exist today because Lincoln often wrote draft messages and a number of them are reproduced in this book.</p><p>It was the telegraph along with other technology and Lincoln's leadership skills that made the President an effective wartime leader.  As Wheeler opines, the President was able to shape public sentiment by communicating directly with multiple interests via the telegraph.  His management of the news also helped. During his re-election campaign in 1864, candidate Lincoln would sit with journalists to discuss the war, emancipation, and his policies, knowing they would transmit his views over the wires to newspapers throughout the North.</p><p>This book, by emphasizing the new technology of the telegraph and its extensive use by the Commander-in-Chief gives a different perspective to the operations during the Civil War and the leadership of Abraham Lincoln.  As the President once said in exasperation with one of his generals, We must use the tools we have.  Lincoln proved his own admonition by his use of the telegraph.  As military historian John Keegan makes clear in his <i>Intelligence in War: Knowledge of the Enemy from Napoleon to Al Qda </i>(2003), War is ultimately about doing, not thinking.

Bradley</i><br><i>Nathan Bedford Forrest:  In Search of the Enigma</i> by Eddy W. Davison and Daniel Foxx<br><p>Nathan Bedford Forrest, one of the most controversial commanders in the Civil War, continues to inspire opposing interpretations.  One of these new books upholds the view that there was no massacre at Fort Pillow whereas the other focuses a magnifying glass on the details of the massacre and other accusations against Forrest, some of them only rumors.  Michl R. Bradley's study provides the first unit history of Forrest's famous Escort Company and staff including information on their postwar reunions.  Bradley, who taught history at Motlow State Community College for thirty-six years and is the author of several other books, seeks to present only the Confederate side of controversial issues.  The members of the Escort and Staff saw one side, their side, Bradley wrote (14).  The book provides valuable new information on the lives of several of the men, unit roster, and new details from the minutes of their reunions from 1877 to 1909.  </p><p>Bradley concludes that the Escort Company of sixty to eighty men was an elite strike force comparable to today's Delta Force (9).  Forrest called on them for the greatest challenges--they often were out in front on frontal assaults; they scouted, conducted intelligence deception by masquerading as deserters, served as advance or rear guards, rounded up stragglers, rescued cannon from capture, and guarded Forrest's invaluable body.   Over twenty were killed in action, including their organizer and first leader, Captain Montgomery Little, struck by enemy fire during the fourth and final assault in the Battle of Thompson's Station.  Later commending them for their attack at Brice's Crossroads and for their continual reliability as scouts, Forrest said that among the men in his command, they are without an equal (115).</p><p>The book reveals the new information that the Escort included two African-American enlisted men:  Private Pleasant Arnold and Private Burrell Buchanan.  Arnold was killed on July 14, 1864, in the Battle of Tupelo, Mississippi, but Buchanan survived and was welcomed into membership of the unit's veteran organization.  He joined the group in their reunion in Petersburg, Tennessee, in 1888, delivered a speech in the 1889 meeting in Tullahoma, and was elected Sergeant at Arms at the 1890 reunion in Murfreesboro.</p><p>Bradley conducted research in pension records, reunion minutes, the <i>Official Records, newspapers, and other primary sources, but relied heavily on lengthy quotations from Confederate Veteran Magazine</i>.  The <i>Confederate Veteran</i> is a valuable source, but the reader would appreciate a narrative of the exciting military operations of the Escort and staff in the scholar's words rather than lengthy quotations that are not interpreted or synthesized in the narrative.  Five quotes from <i>Confederate Veteran</i> each run for at least one full page of indented text, and one non-indented quotation runs for nine and one-half pages.  </p><p>Bradley concludes that no massacre occurred at Fort Pillow and states that the U.S. Congressional Committee on the Conduct of the War rejected the atrocity stories and failed to uncover the reasons why it happened (11).  John Cimprich's <i>Fort Pillow, a Civil War Massacre, and Public Memory</i> (2005) appeared after these two books went into production and understandably is not mentioned.  As Cimprich thoroughly explains, the report of the committee concluded that all of the atrocity charges were confirmed by the evidence and claimed that the reason for the killing of individual Union soldiers after they surrendered was Confederate government policy toward African-American Union soldiers.  From the view of the committee, they had explained why the massacre occurred.   </p><p>Bradley's book relies almost completely on a quotation of Forrest's chief of staff, Major Charles W. Anderson, to inform the reader of the military action at Fort Pillow.  He commends the account in Nathaniel Cheairs Hughes, Jr. with Connie Walton Moretti and James Michl Browne, <i>Brigadier General Tyree H. Bell, C.S.A.:  Forrest's Fighting Lieutenant</i> (2004).  Bradley argues that this book's analysis of Fort Pillow is fair and judicious and maintains historical perspective (98).  This is true, and Hughes and his fellow authors concluded that there was a massacre and that Bell as a brigade commander should have attempted to stop the killing.  Following the commendable example of Hughes, Moretti, and Browne, the reader may ask if the same might apply to Anderson.  Could he have done more to stop the killing?  Forrest ordered him to take a detachment to the riverbank to prevent Union steamboats from landing, and this placed him in a key position below the bluff.

Their intended audience is students and general readers; accordingly, the book relies mostly on published primary and secondary sources.  The authors present little new information, but they succeed in providing a valuable synthesis.  Their narrative of Forrest's raids is detailed, clearly written, lively, and entertaining.   </p><p>Davison and Foxx portray Forrest as a violent man who from his youth on the frontier in middle Tennessee learned that for him the key to success was immediate and fierce action (19).  He loved fighting, and you could see it in the transformation that came over him in battle--his eyes blazed, his face flushed, and his manner became more domineering.  The authors describe his confrontations throughout his life, from when at the age of sixteen he shot his neighbor's bull to his testimony for Congress on the Ku Klux Klan.  </p><p>Forrest ignored Napoleon's maxims and government regulations.  He distributed captured weapons to his men, threatened no quarter if an enemy refused to surrender, and frequently practiced deception.  Using fear as a psychological force multiplier, he directed elaborate ruses that caused enemy commanders to exaggerate his strength.  In daylight, he would march the same men back and forth, first as infantry and then as cavalry.  He had artillery batteries appear and reappear on hillsides, and in one case his opponent estimated that he had fifteen cannon when he had only two.  At night he would light many bivouac fires and have the men shout loud commands as though they were being reinforced.  On the night of December 17, 1861, he staged one of these shows for captured Unionist civilians and set them free to report to Union General Jeremiah C. Sullivan a few miles away in Jackson, Tennessee.  The next day Sullivan reported Forrest's strength at five times what it was; Forrest's 2,000 men had become 10,000 in Sullivan's mind.  </p><p>The authors critically examine what they call the dark side of Forrest, such as rumors that he personally shot or ordered the shooting of captured civilians.  They report a 1903 article in a local newspaper that had a reputed eyewitness account of Forrest ordering the execution of two African American men captured in the fight at Trenton, Tennessee on December 20, 1862.  Davison and Foxx conclude that the report could well be true (107).  </p><p>They prefer not to call the killing at Fort Pillow a massacre, but make it very clear that many Union soldiers, mostly African Americans, were shot while surrendering or after they surrendered.  In a panic, several of the Union men ran to the river, jumped in, and were killed attempting to swim to safety.  Forrest said later in a speech that the Mississippi River was stained red with blood for two hundred yards.  The authors agree with the standard interpretation that there is no evidence that Forrest ordered the massacre; indeed, as others have written they emphasize that discipline broke down and once Forrest arrived on the scene, he stopped the killing.  </p><p>Davison and Foxx agree with recent Forrest biographers that he did not organize the Ku Klux Klan but was an enthusiastic member who organized dens on his business trips.  In 1870 he ordered the Klan disbanded and withdrew from membership.  In emphasizing that Forrest was a complex individual who defies categorization, the authors suggest that less than two years before he died Forrest went far beyond the prejudices of his day to advocate equality for African Americans.  In a speech delivered before a black social organization in late 1875, he declared that African Americans should have equal opportunity in business, agriculture and law.  Edwin C.

3781|9780810000000|$25.00 hardcover|Slavery, Emancipation & Freedom: Comparative Perspectives|\N|Engerman, Stanley L.|\N|\N|<h3>An Anything but Peculiar Institution</h3><br><h3> Slavery in a World Perspective </h3><p>Few historians have written more about slavery than Stanley Engerman, professor of history at the University of Rochester.  Perhaps most closely associated with the landmark <i>Time on the Cross</i>, a quantitative study of American slavery, Engerman's record of scholarship extends deep into the Atlantic World.  His latest book grew from the Walter Lynwood Fleming Lectures at Louisiana State University and is a synthesis of his vast knowledge of slavery and abolition in the western hemisphere.  It is a wonderful introduction to the vagaries of slavery and serves as a guide to the important issues and scholarship that currently guides scholarly inquiry into enslavement and its aftermath.</p><p>Americans might associate slavery with the phrase the peculiar institution, but Engerman rightly explains that slavery was anything but peculiar.  Slavery has been omnipresent in world history and remained a global phenomenon long after Americans fought (and died) over its future in the United States.  The book admirably brings American slavery into sharp relief through a description of the ways in which bondage played out in other cultures.  Engerman notes that slavery was often reserved for outsiders but not all outsiders became slaves, a concept that came to define American slavery.  Americans followed the examples of Europeans by relying on race to define the parameters of slavery, but these ideas came under siege when abolitionists challenged the belief that slaves were not insiders and thus entitled to basic human rights. This shift in the intellectual terrain altered the terms of debate even if all of the antislavery arguments were in place by the start of the nineteenth century.  </p><p>Engerman argues persuasively that the institution of slavery derived strength from its ability to adapt to various technologies and conditions of labor.  Masters ensured this flexibility and achieved a high rate of productivity through their reliance on incentives within slavery.  While American slavery was similar to other forms of thralldom, demographics set it apart.  More so than anywhere else, the population growth of slaves in America equaled that of the white population.  This high rate of fertility meant that American slaves probably had better material conditions than their counterparts in the rest of the hemisphere.  The debate over the relative treatment of slaves has been a contentious one over the years, and Engerman treads carefully enough to make a convincing case.</p><p>Just like slavery itself, emancipation varied widely across time and space.  And once again the situation in the United States both typical and atypical.  Not surprisingly, Engerman relies heavily on economic causes to explain the demise of slavery, and he could have paid more attention to ideological factors.  For instance, he notes how the Black Death in England drove up the price of labor and made free labor relatively dear, but quickly moves past notions of slavery as a moral evil and what motivated abolitionists.  The vagaries of emancipation are too numerous to recount here, but freedom in the United States violated the tendency towards the hemispheric norms of compensation to slave owners and peacetime legislation.  In the United States -- strange as it may seem -- there was probably more commitment to the rights of the newly freed than in most other countries.  Former slaves in America achieved higher incomes and better economic growth than their peers in other nations.  Perhaps this surprising development is related to the abrupt nature of the American Civil War, but Engerman does not speculate.</p><p>Engerman's narrative loses some of its force towards the end of the book and he makes some questionable or unclear claims.  For instance, Engerman dismisses the notion that a significant commitment of land and assistance from the Freedmen's Bureau would have provided long-term economic gains for the former slaves.  Perhaps he is correct, but for individuals starting at the lowest rung of the socio-economic ladder, direct government help could have staved off the ravages of sharecropping.  A more complete discussion would have been helpful.  Engerman also sees a sharp break in southern race relations in the 1890s, a position that leans too heavily on C. Vann Woodward's battered paradigm.  Finally, Engerman is a bit unclear in his description of how and why black voting decreased in the 1890s.  He writes that literacy tests and grandfather clauses sharply reduced black voting in the South, a statement that is misleading (65).  Southern legislatures used legislation to disfranchise blacks but implemented literacy tests and grandfather clauses to retain the vote for poor whites.</p><p>Engerman's book, though, should not be remembered for a few missteps in the later pages.  It is a clear, coherent, and useful synthesis of the economics of slavery, emancipation, and freedom in the western hemisphere.  For the foreseeable future, it will remain the starting point for understanding these most important issues in American -- and world -- history.</p><p><i>Robert Gudmestad is an assistant professor of history at Colorado State University.

3782|9781570000000|$29.95 hardcover|A Soldier to the Last: Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler in Blue and Gray|\N|Longacre, Edward G.|\N|\N|<h3>Joe Wheeler's Cavalry</h3><br><h3>An Unembellished Account</h3><p>Fightin' Joe Wheeler was one of a seemingly endless parade of notable cavalry commanders spawned by the Confederacy during the four years of the Civil War.  Many of their biographers, if not most, seem to have fallen victim to biographer's syndrome, a dreadful affliction that renders the biographer so enmeshed in the personality of their subject that they tell the tale of a man whom they <i>wished</i> had existed, instead of the man who <i>really</i> existed.  Of course the often-astonishing exploits of these Confederate knights of the saddle makes infection all too easy, but the consequences are that many of the horse-soldiers have been transformed ? in the literature ? into virtual demigods.</p><p>Careful reading of many of those biographies also suggests either that their authors did not fully understand the actual role of cavalry in a 19th century army, or that they chose to ignore or minimize the more mundane aspects of the life of a cavalryman. Many biographies foster the widespread perception that the sole function of cavalry was to conduct glamorous and exciting deep penetration raids behind enemy lines during which they wrought terror and havoc upon a hapless and helpless enemy, and returned crowned in glory: Jeb Stuart riding completely around Union General George McClellan's army before Gettysburg, or Nathan Bedford Forrest wrecking Union communications and spreading panic in West Tennessee in the summer of 1862, just before the final offensive that brought Vicksburg down. </p><p>Edward Longacre is different. In his hands, Joseph Wheeler's cavalry is shown without embellishment in its proper role as one component of the triad of services comprising an army: cavalry, infantry, and artillery.  He actually tells the story of Civil War cavalry like it was.  Far from being a life of glorious saber-swinging charges by cavaliers with feathers in their hats, wreathed in clouds of glory and echoing triumphant trumpet blasts, it was mostly a life of incredible hardship and privation, of endless rain-drenched hours in the saddle with no time to stop and cook a hot meal, and always interspersed with sharp, vicious little mini-battles with their blue-coated counterparts.  That is because the primary function of the cavalry was to act as the eyes and ears of the army.  They probed enemy lines to obtain information, not to seek a fight.  When not gathering intelligence, they guarded the flanks of an army on the march; they covered the rear of an army in retreat; they acted as a trip-wire to give warning of enemy movements; they guarded wagon trains carrying supplies; when rations were short for the priceless infantry, their mobility allowed them to forage over wider sweeps of countryside. Their role in battle was usually limited to protecting the flanks of the infantry formations and doing their best to dislocate enemy turning movements.  Only rarely, and then only under special circumstances, did the commanding general send them on raids behind enemy lines. Even in such cases, their mission was not to fight, but rather to burn enemy wagon trains or destroy bridges and railroads.  When the army commander did send them on a raid, it was only after carefully weighing the potential damage to the enemy's logistics against the temporary loss (or permanent loss, if the raiders were lost in the process!) of his eyes and ears.</p><p> Especially during periods of withdrawal or retreat the duties of the cavalry became onerous indeed; these were often periods during which the cavalry suffered intensely, not only from constant skirmishing with the advancing enemy, but from exhaustion, hunger, exposure, and sometimes the despair that is the inevitable handmaiden of defeat.  The infantry could often rest; the cavalry could not.  In this regard, it well to remember that despite the infantry's oft-repeated slur Who ever saw a dead cavalryman? the infantry nevertheless held the cavalry in esteem, because they knew that, at least in a well-commanded army, between them and the enemy there was always a screen of cavalrymen who would protect the infantry no matter how tired, wet, and hungry they were.  All of this Longacre makes clear.  And this is a service to the readers of Civil War history that is long overdue.</p><p>Nor is that all.  He makes it very clear that in company with many other commanders of both Blue and Gray, Wheeler's more-than-generous ego led him to exaggerate his achievements and minimize his defeats.  On more than one occasion his tendency to inflate the numbers of men available for duty led his army commanders, first Braxton Bragg and then John Bell Hood, to undertake operations that were premised on cavalry strengths that simply did not exist ? except in Wheeler's imagination.  It is refreshing indeed to have a biographer present even one of the great cavalry leaders as merely human.</p><p>That having been said, Longacre's book is not without flaws.  If, as Belisarius of Byzantium is alleged to have said, <i>strategy is no more than applied geography</i>, then as a matter of principle, every study of military operations should be supported by maps on which are noted every geographic place-name mentioned in the text.   Longacre's maps of Bragg's 1862 campaign in Kentucky do not meet this criterion.  Even though I am not unfamiliar with the geography of Kentucky, I was lost much of the time.  The same is true of the map covering Sherman's campaign in the Carolinas.</p><p>Perhaps less important but still significant, Longacre is absolutely meticulous about keeping the reader aware of the moment-by-moment composition of the forces under Wheeler's control.  The problem is that, especially toward the end of the war, the composition changed on an almost daily basis, and reading a listing of those changes is rather like reading I Chronicles: 1-8; it may be important to genealogists, but it lacks narrative verve.  </p><p>In sum, Longacre has produced a book which every student of the Civil War should acquire, in part because it presents the most accurate picture of 19th century cavalry operations yet available, in part because it provides an invaluable insight into how the Confederacy?plagued by ever-diminishing resources?managed its war in the West, and finally because it is a thorough and deeply thoughtful portrait of Joseph Wheeler, who despite his flaws was truly a Confederate Paladin.</p><p><i>Warren E.

3783|9781570000000|$39.95 hardcover|Through the Howling Wilderness: The 1864 Red River Campaign and Union Failure in the West|\N|Joiner, Gary D.|\N|\N|<h3>Failure on the Red River</h3<br><p>Of all the Civil War campaigns that took place in the Trans-Mississippi Department, historians have appropriately devoted the most attention to the failed Union attempt to occupy western Louisiana and eastern Texas in 1864. Gary D. Joiner's monograph <i>Through the Howling Wilderness: The 1864 Red River Campaign and Union Failure in the West</i> represents the latest attempt to explain the strange mixture of politics, economics, and military strategy that doomed the Union effort. Joiner, director of the Red River Regional Studies Center in Shreveport, published another work on the subject, <i>One Damn Blunder from Beginning to End: The Red River Campaign of 1864</i>, in 2004. Together, these books constitute the most up to date scholarship on the topic.</p><p>Whereas Joiner's earlier work concentrated primarily on the military aspects of the campaign in northwest Louisiana, <i>Through the Howling Wilderness</i> gives the reader a much more comprehensive view of the nature of the campaign, from grand strategy to the experiences of ordinary soldiers. The author devotes considerable space to the context of the campaign on both sides. Joiner argues that the real prize for the Union in 1864 was Shreveport, at that time the Confederate capital of Louisiana and the headquarters of the Trans-Mississippi Department, as well as a major naval, military, and industrial target. Far from being a backwater of the war, the author shows that Shreveport was a heavily fortified city that served as the focal point of Confederate industry, such as the arms depot in nearby Tyler, Texas. The city also represented a threat to the Union navy, as the Confederates had an ironclad, the <i>CSS Missouri</i>, and several submarines in Shreveport that posed a threat to Union control of the Mississippi.  </p><p>Joiner assigns primary blame for the Union failure to General Nathaniel P. Banks. A Massachusetts Republican, and possible rival to Abraham Lincoln's reelection campaign, the highly political Banks viewed the advance on Shreveport in political terms. He wanted Union control of the rich cotton-growing districts along the Red River to satisfy textile mill owners in his home state. Banks also wanted to capture Shreveport to depose the Confederate state government and install one loyal to the Union under Lincoln's ten per cent plan. </p><p>Banks's lack of military knowledge and political ambition did not constitute the only reasons for the Union disaster. Within the army, Generals Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman distrusted Banks and preferred an attack on Mobile, Alabama, rather than the Louisiana expedition. Inter-service rivalry and competing demands for manpower led to a dangerous situation where the expedition had three elements: Banks's troops from New Orleans, ten thousand men from Sherman's command, and a virtually independent naval contingent under Admiral David Dixon Porter. Joiner does a superb job of explaining how the Confederate naval threat led Porter to use heavy ironclads unsuitable for the Red River above the falls at Alexandria. The admiral's anxiety nearly led to the loss of the fleet in shallow waters, but fortunately engineer Colonel Bailey constructed a dam that enabled the fleet to escape.</p><p>Joiner argues that poor planning by Banks ultimately caused the Union defeat at Mansfield and subsequent Battle of Pleasant Hill. As the army marched north of Natchitoches, Banks decided to turn away from the river and forego the support of Porter's gunboats. Even worse, the Union commander concentrated his forces on one road in the Howling Wilderness of northwestern Louisiana instead of advancing on different approaches. Joiner shows that Banks's marching order, with the supply train jammed between the cavalry and advance infantry elements, meant that supporting units could not reach the battlefield quickly. This error and the aggressive tactics of Confederate Major General Richard Taylor led to a humiliating defeat and the abandonment of the entire campaign by Banks.</p><p>Joiner concentrates on the fighting in Louisiana, but he does not ignore the other element of the Union campaign, the attempt by Major General Frederick Steele to advance from Little Rock, Arkansas, and help Banks capture Shreveport. The author explains the convoluted nature of the campaign in Arkansas clearly. Steele faced even worse problems of supply and coordination than had Banks, ultimately leading to a strategic defeat at the hands of a numerically inferior enemy and a retreat to Little Rock.</p><p>The author concludes by arguing that the failure of the Red River Campaign represented a huge setback to the Union and delayed the end of the war by squandering two infantry corps that Sherman could have put to better use as part of his Georgia campaign. Instead of capturing Shreveport, Banks' failure had the effect of ending any real effort by the Union in the Trans-Mississippi. <i>Through the Howling Wilderness</i> is the best monograph available on a relatively unknown campaign. Thanks to Joiner, historians and Civil War buffs alike can understand the bizarre story of the Red River Campaign.</p><p><i>Charles V.

3784|9781570000000|$37.00 hardcover|Touching the Web of Southern Novelists|\N|Madden, David|\N|\N|"<h3>An Interdisciplinary Perspective of the Civil War</h3><br><p>David Madden is one of the South's most productive writers.  As writer, editor, and teacher, his interests are wide-ranging, and he has published literary fiction, poetry, plays for stage and radio, film scripts, books and articles of criticism, and essays on a wide variety of subjects ranging from history to popular culture.  This new book, <i>Touching the Web of Southern Novelists</i>, gathers together essays on Robert Penn Warren, William Faulkner, Katherine Anne Porter, Flannery O'Connor, Thomas Wolfe, Ernest Gaines, Jesse Hill Ford, Carson McCullers, George Garrett, Barry Hannah, Cormac McCarthy, James Agee, and Evelyn Scott--and one short story about Agee.  The book includes a chronological bibliography of other essays on Southern writers and an analytical index.</p><p>As Madden says in his Introduction: What a Tangled Web We Weave When We Practice Fiction the concept behind this collection of essays is . . . a blend of fondness for the writers and their work and a complex interest in their art (3).  And, he continues:  Among other elements in these essays, implied even when not overtly discussed, is the effect of the Civil War upon southern witnesses (3).  (Madden's use of the term Civil War embraces the antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction eras.)  Madden's approach to the works of these thirteen writers--nearly all of whom are, he points out, among the greatest American, not just Southern, writers (3)--is the technique of the charged image (3).  His introduction details the felt, personal connections he has with each of the writers whose work he discusses and provides an emotional as well as intellectual way into each of the essays that follows.</p><p>David Madden is uniquely qualified to examine the effect of that war on southern fiction. His most recently published novel is an innovative fiction about the Civil War, <i>Sharpshooter</i> (1996), and he is the founder and former director of the United States Civil War Center at Louisiana State University.  It is his opinion that no Northerner can write a true Civil War novel; that <i>all</i> southern fiction comes out of the Civil War, and that <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> is the best Civil War novel ever written, not <i>even though</i> but <i>because</i> it is not overtly about the war.  And that is one of several provocative notions for which he makes a compelling case in this collection of essays.</p><p>The charged image of the web referred to in the book's title, links these various pieces.  At first glance, they seem too varied to be more than superficially connected, but by the end of the book the tangled lines of trajectory between the essays and the writers discussed intersect in ways both artful and, frequently, intuitive.</p><p>Madden takes the web as his book's unifying figure from the charged image of the spider web as described by Jack Burden in Chapter IV of <i>All the King's Men</i>.  In Robert Penn Warren's <i>All the King's Men</i>: The Charged Image of the Web Madden talks about the disparate implications of Burden's metaphor and of Madden's concept of the charged image partly inspired by Ezra Pound's definition of literature: Literature is language charged with meaning; great literature is simply language charged with meaning to the utmost degree (33).  That, of course, recalls Pound's notion of an image as:  that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time.  Which is how these essays work--through the juxtaposition of intellect and emotion.  Madden's introduction and this first essay on Warren establish the tone of the whole collection.  The first essay offers a fresh approach to Warren's fiction, and it establishes the charged image of <i>this</i> book: that of the web of personal and literary connections Madden feels for several important Southern writers. </p><p>In William Faulkner's <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> Quentin! Listen! Madden says: The techniques fiction writers use are in themselves expressions of meaning and conveyors to the reader of experience (48).  He asserts that there are two Faulkners in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>, . . . one the artist at work, the other Faulkner's alter ego, given the name Quentin (47).  Madden emphasizes the importance of Faulkner's teaching the reader how to read <i>Absalom</i>, employing myriad innovative techniques to show the reader through implication what cannot be overtly expressed.  Form and content really are inseparable; the medium really is the message.</p><p>The poet Wallace Stevens wonders which to prefer, the beauty of inflection or of innuendo.  <i>Touching the Web of Southern Novelists</i> gives the reader a dual, bifocal view of the works discussed, because Madden risks public speculation about private feelings--as in Jesse Hill Ford: On the Loose which may be more about Madden than Ford.   (Madden frequently points out that all first-person stories are about the narrator.)  Many of these essays are about the writer's double consciousness (William Faulkner and his alter ego Quentin, Thomas Wolfe and his memory of his young self imaginatively watching his father watching Civil War soldiers pass, James Agee fresh out of Harvard lying in an Alabama sharecropper's bed and glorying in the discomfort of bed bugs).  Madden probes the relationship of fact to fiction, the mysteries of what Oscar Wilde calls the telling of beautiful untrue things. </p> 			<p>Flannery O'Connor: Old Testament Christian Storyteller expresses Madden's personal struggle with the works of a writer with whom he has had a love/hate relationship and also reveals aspects of Madden's personal spirituality.  Cormac McCarthy's <i>The Orchard Keepe</i>r: Web Montage offers a list of parallels between Madden and McCarthy, both raised in Knoxville, Tennessee, and confesses to a sense of rivalry with McCarthy that Madden overcomes by thoughtfully revisiting McCarthy's fiction.  Barry Hannah: Geronimo Rex's Thirty-three Years' Reign, a retrospective look at a review Madden wrote in 1972 of Barry Hannah's first novel, adds a significant southern novelist to the web, as do essays on Ernest Gaines, Carson McCullers, and Evelyn Scott, a writer Madden believes deserves much more attention. Though he readily reveals his struggles with the works of O'Connor, Agee, Hannah, and McCarthy, all of these struggles end with Madden surrendering to the power of the work.  He obviously loves much that he finds in these writers--even if it is tough love, it is clearly love.	</p><p>Thomas Wolfe: A Reed of Demonic Ecstasy is a dramatic performance piece that vividly maintains Madden's personal voice by weaving together his essay voice, his (childhood) fictive voice, and Wolfe's fictive voice.  This whimsical piece, partly truth and partly fiction, leads to a second, more serious, performance piece on Wolfe.  George Garrett: Continually Astonished by Everything continues Madden's exploration of the writer's double consciousness, here applied to the works of one of the most innovative and influential Southern writers of the twentieth century.  Madden's pursuit of the other-man theme in Garrett's army fictions (amplified by Garrett's autobiography and by some of his academic pieces) demonstrates Madden's unique critical approach.  His paired, doubled, other-man image offers a new way of understanding Garrett's fiction even as it echoes the guiding principle of the connecting web.</p><p>Katherine Anne Porter's Flowering Judas:' The Charged Image of Laura and Braggioni amplifies the motif of a web of connections.  Just one example of this is the discussion of Porter's tableau technique: . . . it vibrates from within, sending its electrical charge in a radial fashion out into the other images connected to it (63).  Here the web image resonates first as a technique within Flowering Judas, then, for the reader of this book, as a thread connecting this essay with the others here collected. 	</p><p>Because Madden's first person voice hovers over these essays, the reader is prepared for the voice of the one piece of fiction, James Agee Never Lived in This House: A Short Story, that immediately follows the essay on <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i>, the short story another line of trajectory in this web of novelists.  The web ripples and vibrates: Quentin moves from storytelling into reality; Madden moves from reality into storytelling.</p><p>The collection concludes with the highly personal, poetic piece William Faulkner's <i>Sanctuary</i>: The Photographs in the 1929 Version in which Madden brings full circle his method of speculating in print (in public) about his private/personal feelings, the felt connections with the web of other Southern writers--the quick and the dead--alive and vibrating in his imagination.  </p><p><i>Touching the Web of Southern Novelists</i> is more than a book of literary essays?it is (like Quentin's book) a drama of consciousness.  The reader feels the web's connection (a kind of assurance) when Madden's overlapping interests echo from one piece into another, and his dramatized responses--simultaneously intellectual and emotional--unify this wide-ranging and unique book. David Madden's attempt to more fully understand how the work and lives of these particular writers from the South influence his work and his life, and how the Civil War affects (overtly or subtly) all fiction by writers from the South, leads him and his reader to a richer appreciation of the Southern literary tradition.  </p><p><i>Allen Wier teaches in the writing program at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.

3785|9780810000000|$45.00 hardcover|Troubled Commemoration: The American Civil War Centennial, 1961-1965|\N|Cook, Robert J.|\N|\N|<h3>Conflict and Commemoration </h3><br><h3>Remembering the Civil War</h3><p>Even during the period of the Civil War centennial, historians were keenly aware of the irony that the commemoration found the United States engaged in a struggle closely resembling the one being commemorated.  In more recent decades, historians Michl Kammen, John Bodnar, and Jim Cullen have probed the significance of the centennial in the larger history of American memory and popular culture. Robert Cook, a professor of American history at the University of Sheffield, England, has produced the first book-length study of the centennial.</p><p><i>Troubled Commemoration</i>, Cook explains in his preface, was not conceived originally as another contribution to the growing corpus of literature on historical memory, but, rather, as a specialized investigation of the Civil War's continuing impact on the United States in the mid-twentieth century (ix).  The book builds on the work of empirical scholars such as David Blight and W. Fitzhugh Brundage more than on the theoretical literature about memory.  Cook's study does not mimic Blight's three narratives of Civil War memory, but occasionally invokes Blight's emancipationist narrative to suggest the limits of the centennial's accomplishments. This perspective is not unexpected given the critical intersection of the centennial with the Civil Rights movement and given Cook's research interest in Civil Rights history.</p><p>Two dominant themes of mid-twentieth-century American history ? the Civil Rights movement and the Cold War ? dominate Cook's study.  In clear prose and an admirably neat organizational scheme (with extremely helpful short chapter introductions and conclusions) Cook develops his argument that a celebration conceived to showcase American unity in the context of Cold War tensions ran afoul the ugly realities of continuing national divisions, primarily over race. Within a year of its formal beginning, Cook argues, the long-planned grand centennial foundered, lost the public interest, and settled for the lesser ? though not inconsequential ? accomplishments of sponsoring scholarship and popular literature. </p><p>Although Cook researched in the papers of the many state Civil War centennial commissions and devotes attention to their work, his focus is on the organization and work of the National Civil War Centennial Commission (CWCC). He reveals that the Commission's 1950s origins contained tension between two competing visions ? one more popular and the other scholarly. All of the centennial's architects were determined to prevent the reopening of sectional wounds.</p><p>Despite the fears of prominent southerners and their states' rights allies that the centennial would cast a harsh light on the Confederacy, the commission appointed in 1957 proved sympathetic with a southern agenda. Chairman U.S. Grant III and Executive Director Karl S. Betts were political conservatives concerned primarily with showing a reunified United States in its best light. Southern organizers soon recognized that the centennial was primarily what Cook terms a weapon in the cultural cold war and, as a result, they were free to celebrate their nineteenth-century past as they saw fit (31). Segregationists further recognized that they could exploit the centennial in their search for a usable past equating the fight of the 1860s with that of the 1960s (78). </p><p>The southern tilt backfired badly in April 1961, in Charleston, South Carolina, where the CWCC National Assembly met to commemorate the Fort Sumter Centennial.  Cook dissects the crisis, the causes, and the consequences of the controversy that erupted when a Charleston hotel refused to accommodate an African-American delegate from New Jersey and the Commission refused to intervene. President John F. Kennedy ordered the Assembly to move to the Charleston Naval Base. Coupled with the ideologically loaded comments by the Southern-born editor of the <i>Saturday Evening Pos</i>t, Ashley Halsey, the Charleston Assembly revealed the potential of the Centennial to reopen old wounds. The Centennial, Cook observes, seemed at best a national embarrassment and at worst a sinister excuse for segregationists to mobilize southern whites on the basis of the Lost Cause (121). </p><p>Further weakening the position of the CWCC's leaders was the next major event, a reenactment of the battle of First Manassas (Bull Run).  Although a commercial and popular success and the kind of event that Karl Betts in particular believed should mark the centennial, the reenactment struck some observers as inappropriate.  Led by historian Bell I. Wiley, the scholarly faction of the Commission forced Betts's ouster late in 1961 and Chairman Grant unexpectedly resigned. Taking their places on the Commission were historian Allan Nevins as chairman and a young Wiley prot?g?, James I. Robertson, Jr., as executive director.</p><p>As if middle-aged Civil War historians will not find it sobering enough that the era that spawned their historical interests is now a fertile field for serious historical study, Cook hauls many familiar Civil War historians before the bar of history. Bell Wiley emerges as something of a heroic figure, searching for a new director who was a Southerner who is also an American and who believes that being an American, and doing such things as voting, riding on the front seat of a bus and eating in public places is not a privilege and a responsibility restricted to folk with white skins (140).  He found that man in Robertson. The new director's difficult role was to help reshape the centennial while at the same time winning the trust of southern leaders who feared that the new leadership would serve a radical agenda.</p><p>Although he shows sympathy for their position, Cook chides Nevins, Robertson, and even Wiley for mollifying southerner leaders at the expense of a broad airing of racial themes and, ultimately, for marginalizing African-Americans (222). The Centennial did not ignore the anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, but Cook scores the CWCC for not including a single African-American speaker at the anniversary event. Quotations from Martin Luther King, Jr., and historian John Hope Franklin reveal that African-American leaders recognized and resented the continuing veto power that the Confederacy wielded over the rest of the nation. The August 1963 March on Washington was King's answer to this influence and to the muted CWCC observation.</p><p>The triumph of the scholarly over the popular vision of the centennial relegated it to a much lower profile in 1962-1965. Cook offers a somewhat superficial overview of the events sponsored by the national, state, and local commissions during those years. He devotes proportionately more attention to national-level publications, scholarly endeavors (including the still-enduring Ulysses S. Grant and Jefferson Davis Papers projects), and films produced or initiated during this era. Considering the importance that he attaches to the tensions between the scholarly and popular visions, Cook gives surprisingly little attention to commercialization and the official efforts to prevent it.</p><p>But <i>Troubled Commemoration</i> is not intended to be an encyclopedic history of the Civil War Centennial and, properly, it does not attempt to note and comment upon every pageant, publication, and product of those years. Striking a healthy balance between depth and breadth, Cook keeps his eyes on the prize ? which is to relate the Centennial to its contemporary contexts of the Cold War and especially the Civil Rights movement.  Cook's own evidence suggests that he desires in retrospect a more enlightened Centennial than the social and political circumstances would realistically allow. </p><p><i>Troubled Commemoration</i> is successful also as a contribution to the empirical study of historical memory.  The line between David Blight's 1865 to 1915 healing over justice and the centennial's marginalization of blacks in the name of national unity is clear.  Cook's book will inspire other historians to determine whether that line were a straight one.</p><p><i>Dr. John M.

3786|9780810000000|$45.00 hardcover|Uncivil War: Five New Orleans Street Battles and the Rise and Fall of Radical Reconstruction|\N|Hogue, James K.|\N|\N|<h3>The Fight over Reconstruction in New Orleans</h3><br><p>James K. Hogue adds an important new perspective to the much-studied topic of Reconstruction in Louisiana by considering the state's politics through the lens of military history.  Taking as his departure point the relative absence of scholarship on Reconstruction as a military phenomenon, Hogue recasts the era as a continuation of the Civil War in an irregular, intermittent, and sometimes clandestine struggle (10). </p><p>This struggle pitted the Republican Party's coalition of African Americans, white northern newcomers, and southern Unionists against Louisiana's white ex-Confederates, who organized behind the Democratic Party. Republicans wanted to create a racially egalitarian, free labor society whereas Democrats wanted to preserve as much as they could of the antebellum racial hierarchy.  While this characterization of Reconstruction as a failed revolution resonates with most scholarship written after the demise of the Dunning school's tragic era account, Hogue breaks new ground in showing how military processes contributed to the downfall of the Republicans and their plan for a new social order.</p><p>Hogue organizes his argument around five New Orleans street battles that occurred between 1865 and 1877.  The incidents marked stages in the evolution of counterrevolutionary tactics.  In an assault that killed at least 38 Republican convention delegates on July 30, 1866, anti-Republican whites, many of them Confederate veterans, enacted the most visible manifestation of a much broader pattern of vigilante violence across racial lines (51). Hogue fits the 1866 street battle into a larger pattern of racial moments of truth that originated in slavery and gained intensity after 1863, when African-American Union military service gave former slaves a fair fight with their white foes.  The northern reaction to the 1866 violence helped Republicans obtain the necessary Congressional majorities to pursue revolutionary change in the South.  In Louisiana, General Phillip Sheridan and Republican Governor Henry Clay Warmoth pursued radical policies with the aid of a superior military organization capable of overawing Ku Klux Klan vigilantes.  </p><p>Counterrevolution entered its second phase in 1873 when white supremacist Democrats abandoned ad hoc vigilantism in favor of better organized paramilitary attacks on Republican power.  William Pitt Kellogg, the Republican claimant in that year's disputed gubernatorial election, used the bi-racial Louisiana State Militia, headed by former Confederate General James Longstreet, to fend off an armed attack by followers of his Democratic challenger.  Although victorious in the state capital, Republicans had been weakened by vacillating federal support, factional infighting, and their inability to make the Louisiana State Militia effective outside New Orleans.  In open alliance with Democratic candidates, white supremacist paramilitaries exploited this vulnerability by driving Republicans out of rural parish governments.  The Colfax Massacre in Grant Parish, Reconstruction's deadliest battle, epitomized this new combination of racialized politics and paramilitary violence.  </p><p>Hogue's analysis of the Crescent City White League, a component of Democrats' loosely organized paramilitary force, shows that its largest group of volunteers had earlier belonged to the Confederacy's Washington Artillery, an elite unit formed by New Orleans merchants and lawyers. The paramilitaries reflected the larger dynamics of the state Democratic Party, in which planters, professionals, and ex-Confederate officers led the mass of the state's white men against any expansion of African-American political and social power.</p><p>In 1877 Democratic paramilitaries entered the final phase of counter-revolution, a successful <i>coup d'etat</i> that toppled Republican government in Louisiana and, as part of the settlement in the contested presidential election of 1876, ended Reconstruction once and for all.  Hogue interprets the street battle of January 9 as an example of the modern <i>coup</i> in which small forces take political power through attacks on key government facilities, such as the legislative halls, courthouses, newspaper offices, and armories.  </p><p>The book concludes by exploring Reconstruction's implications for the U.S. military and state-run National Guards.  Hogue argues that southern opposition to federal intervention combined with career soldiers' reluctance to re-engage civilian politics to restrict the size of the U.S. army and increase the power of state-run National Guards.</p> <p>Hogue's argument is persuasive, based on impressive research, and full of suggestive arguments about racial conflict and the place of Louisiana Reconstruction in the broader pattern of nineteenth century political and military history. If there is a flaw in Hogue's research model it lies in explaining what social and ideological factors helped each side maintain cohesiveness over the twelve-year span of Reconstruction.  Hogue attributes the zeal of White Leaguers to unrepentant white supremacist and Confederate sympathies. Republican motives, especially those of Republican leaders like Kellogg and his predecessors Henry Clay Warmoth and P.B.S. Pinchback, are harder to identify. While Hogue eschews the Dunning school's blanket condemnations of Republicans, he does see spoils as a primary influence.  In contrast, Ted Tunnell's recent biography of carpetbagger Marshall Twitchell, whose family was murdered by White Leaguers not far from Grant Parish, describes at least one northern-born Republican officeholder who risked a great deal for comparatively little personal gain.  Similarly, Rebecca Scott's comparative history of Louisiana and Cuba brings out the complex play of forces that permitted or prevented military and political mobilization by former slaves. Having a safe space to organize politically and the economic resources to act free of employer coercion greatly aided the foes of Reconstruction while the same factors circumscribed the ability of black Louisianans, the largest constituency of radical reconstruction, from achieving the same level of military readiness. </p><p>Although these perspectives might deepen the reach of Hogue's insights into Louisiana politics, these same books could be faulted for their inattention to the military perspective on state politics that Hogue provides.  Not only is <i>Uncivil War</i> a valuable addition to the study of Reconstruction, but it also enhances historians' understanding of the coercive side of American politics and offers a timely case study of past efforts at peacekeeping during an irregular civil war. </p><p><i>Frank Towers is an associate professor of history at the University of Calgary.

3787|9780140000000|$18.00 softcover|Upon the Altar of the Nation: A Moral History of the Civil War|\N|Stout, Harry S.|\N|\N|<h3>What Constitutes an Just War?</h3><br><h3>Morality and the Civil War</h3><p>An ambitious undertaking, Stout attempts to apply the evolving concept of just-war theory, especially in examining the actual conduct of war, to fashion a moral history of the Civil War.  His question then is not how the war was fought, won, or lost.   Rather, Stout examines how the Civil War was conducted morally?given the immorality of war in itself?under the rubric that permits wars of self-defense, requires proportional measures in response to actual threats, and provides protection for civilian lives and property.  He concludes that the expenditure of blood, the preservation of Lincoln's last, best hope, and the ending of slavery makes the war just.</p><p>Quite appropriately, Stout focuses on the planning and execution of battles, the incidences of inappropriate violence, and needless suffering.  He makes a solid demonstration of the link between the homefront and battlefield.  And save for a few gaffes with terminology?confusing corps with brigades on page 231?his military history is generally sound.  Unlike Steven Woodworth's magisterial treatment of the evolving religious world of actual combat soldiers, Stout examines the evolving ideas of civilian and military leaders, clergy, and the religious press as shapers of opinion, grappling with the horrific moral landscape of Civil War.  </p><p>Stout recognizes that both Northerners and Southerners held consistent moral views about the war, its causes, and the merits of their respective civilizations, and he avoids the tendency of some recent scholars to suggest that views discredited by events cannot have been seriously believed by those who articulated them.  Southern soldiers and their leaders believed slavery was a moral system before the war; they did not abandon their beliefs in slavery or white supremacy just because Lee surrendered.   Northern Democrats and Irish immigrants who opposed Lincoln's war acted on their perceptions of right, race, and interest.</p><p>Stout traces an evolving theory of warfare, from the limited war of suppressing the rebellion and respecting civilians and their slave property, through the articulation of a broader rubric of war drafted largely by Francis Lieber, which Lincoln issued as General Order No. 100.  In Stout's reasonable argument, the goal of winning the war and the broad justification for conduct that is militarily necessary allowed the Civil War to become a total war.  </p><p>Stout is at his best in describing how southern civilians reacted to total war.  One can easily see through the network of sermons and the press how Southerners learned of apparent atrocities to southern civilians and then created an evidentiary litany that became one jack in the ladder of the Lost Cause.  </p><p>Although well worth reading, the book fails on several counts. First, he makes the Emancipation Proclamation Lincoln's tool to escalate the limited war to the total war he thought necessary to preserve the Union.  Historically, this is arguing a distant result for a cause.  Indeed, Lincoln's preliminary Emancipation Proclamation can be read as an attempt to stop the war with slavery intact.  </p><p>Once the war becomes total, Stout seems to suggest that there are few practical limits on moral conduct besides proscribing outright rape and murder (which did occur during the Civil War).  He suggests that throughout the conduct of the Civil War, an emerging civil religion which transmogrified the New Isrl of New England into a missionary nation of the United States took root in mental soil sanctified by the blood of martyrs.  This civil religion became a bond of postwar union.  He then provides examples of how the American sense of moral rectitude led to atrocities against indigenous Americans after the Civil War.</p><p>Stout's argument is not convincing, and indeed his afterword seems to argue for a conclusion contrary to what he states.  The Civil War cannot be adjudged as moral simply because its participants thought it was and it preserved the Union.  Because the United States went on to play a massive role in the world and its experiment in democratic union benefited many of its citizens and inspired others to seek political freedom and material comfort begs the question of the morality of the Civil War.  Other people thought themselves victimized or can be shown as victimized by its outcome. To turn Lincoln's phrase, this is still an argument of might makes right.  Just war theory evolved to provide cover for institutions and states to do what they needed to do in order to survive, including sacrificing lives to preserve others. And its application is at best only a guide to what remains a highly subjective judgment about morality. </p><p>Stout's Lincoln, who emerges as both practitioner of <i>realpolitik</i> and sage prophet, might be a better guide.  At the end of war, he believed that Providence was in charge of events, but he could not say on whose side the Almighty was fighting.  He was content to trust in the justness and rectitude of a higher authority than himself or human theorists.</p><p>In conclusion, Stout's willingness to ask moral questions is meritorious.  But given the limits of history as a discipline and lacking a real metric to impose upon the chaos of Civil War, he can still only assert what he believes the complex evidence shows.  One is sympathetic to his clarion call to contemporary citizens to insist that their government, when it wars, conducts war with justice and ends it with mercy.  But using the logic of just war theory, these citizens might be censured for undermining the just war being waged in their name.</p><p><i>Edward R.

3788|9780810000000|$40.00 hardcover|The View From the Ground: Experiences of Civil War Soldiers|\N|Sheehan-Dean, Aaron , ed.|\N|\N|<h3>Common Men in Combat</h3><br><p>What was it really like to be a common soldier in the American Civil War? Scholars from Bell I. Wiley to James M. McPherson have studied this question over the decades, as have legions of Civil War buffs. A new collection of essays titled <i>The View From the Ground: Experiences of Civil War Soldiers</i>ns the discussion with nine stimulating articles from the next generation of Civil War historians. In total these are a very interesting guide to current trends in the scholarly literature on the titanic struggle that defined America.</p><p>Chandra Manning leads off with a look at how Union solders dealt with the issues of slavery, race, and emancipation. Her thesis, now expanded into a significant new book, is that Yankee troopers had little idea about what role the slaves would play in the struggle. In time and after the heat of combat and tours of duty in the South, many became convinced that the peculiar institution had to be destroyed in order to preserve the Union. The boys in blue, in Manning's view, were the first Americans to deal with the question of race in the mid-1860s, and that they had at least the potential to lead a reunited nation into some form of  racial equality. That this did not happen seems to be the war's greatest missed opportunity.</p><p>Two essays follow up on the theme of armies and their connection, and impact, on the home front. Lisa Laskin examines how civilian Confederates may have degraded the morale of the Army of Northern Virginia. She concludes that by 1865 the folks at home were often the most capable of weakening soldier resolve and causing desertion. Laskin sees the lack of will to continue the fight as almost a rebel stab in the back that depleted Lee's army as the war reached its climax. On the northern side, Timothy J. Orr sees Pennsylvania troops as being so hostile to anti-war Democrats behind the lines that political violence was a frightening possibility. Partisan politics in the Keystone State and the rest of the North did not end with the firing on Fort Sumter. Ongoing friction between the home front and the front line, according to Orr, could have indeed turned into another civil war.</p><p>The religious life of soldiers blue and grey has attracted the interest of an increasing number of historians in recent years, and <i>The View From the Ground</i> presents two such studies. Kent T. Dollar discusses Christian solders in both armies in the early months of the war, and finds that camp life tended not to diminish the faith of the devout. Clinging to religious traditions in the forms of church services or bible study became an important coping mechanism as civilians became soldiers. These men set the stage for the wave of revivals and religious activity that swept through both Union and Confederate forces by the beginning of 1863. David W. Rolfs analyzes how Union troops had to reconcile their religious ideals with the hard realities of life in the ranks and in the crucible of battle. Christian soldiers were pressed to become members of a very secular army and, in theory, kill their fellow man on command.</p><p>The motivation to smite such enemies is the theme of Jason Phillips's piece on Confederate perceptions of the Union foe. In his view the struggle was far from being a war without hate between the combatants. Rebel troops in many cases truly despised what they considered to be hordes of invading Yankee barbarians. Such abhorrence only increased after the Emancipation Proclamation and the North's adoption of a hard war strategy.  These veterans, contrary to popular belief, carried this rancor in their hearts after Appomattox and on into the post-war South.</p><p>The meaning of the War Between the States and its place in American memory is not neglected in this volume. Charles E. Brooks uses the experience of a luckless colonel in the Confederate Fourth Texas Infantry Regiment to argue that rebel solders insisted on being led by officers they respected but not driven into battle. He sees southern enlisted men as true Jacksonians with ambivalent attitudes toward members of the elite who might command them. These soldiers were fighting, according to Brooks, for a republican society far more than for the interests of the slaveholding aristocracy. Such wartime conflicts continued on into Reconstruction and often centered on conflicting claims of battlefield credit. Kevin M. Levin looks at competing memories over which troops, Virginians or South Carolinians, did the most to repel the Federals in the 1864 battle of the Crater at Petersburg. Such veterans' feuds, according to the author, helped the ex-Confederates deal with the reality of defeat by focusing on past military valor.</p><p>These essays are well-written and succinctly argued, and make a contribution to our understanding of the greatest war in American history, and how it was influenced by those who fought in it. However, nothing appears on the experiences of African-American soldiers, and here the editor missed an opportunity for a more comprehensive volume. Such an omission is hard to understand considering how much work has been done, and is being done, on the black experience in the Civil War. This criticism aside, <i>The View From the Ground</i> helps the modern reader to understand what motivated and sustained these brave men as they faced the greatest challenge of their lives.</p><p><i>Robert A.

3789|9780300000000|$30.00 hardcover|West from Appomattox: The Reconstruction of America after the Civil War|\N|Richardson, Heather Cox|\N|\N|<h3>The Idealized West and Reconstruction</h3><br><p><i>West from Appomattox</i> by Heather Cox Richardson offers an ambitious synthesis of the decades after the Civil War; she shifts the vantage point from race in the South to incorporate western and national developments as well.  The author is no neophyte, having written two previous books on the northern response to the Civil War era.  <i>West from Appomattox</i> has something meaningful to say, but the treatment raises a variety of interpretive issues.</p> <p>This work examines what might be termed the dominant?middle and upper class?opinion of the equally-dominant northeastern region, from the Civil War to the turn of the century.   The focus is on mainstream Americans?those vocal and powerful men and women who prospered in the dynamic postwar economy (344).  Richardson argues that prosperous northerners remained wedded to concepts of individualism; they distrusted special interests that used government to advance what seemed a class agenda.  The emergence of corporate capitalism and its growing influence over the Republican Party disturbed them, but working class radicalism and immigrant-based machine politics troubled them more.  Agrarian demands for monetary inflation were more unsettling than corporate misdeeds.  The dominant national viewpoint is thus seemingly identified with what used to be called mugwump sentiment, with independent-minded, educated, and rather ethnocentric easterners.  Most often, the political opinion of the polite classes could sway national elections.  Because the Democratic constituency was susceptible to the farmers' and working class demands for change, particularly in time of economic depression, the Republicans looked like the safer choice. </p><p>I am not sure how original professional historians will think this approach, but there is such a thing as the common sense of the comfortable classes, and this vantage point conveys a lot well.  Readers of Richardson's previous book on the press and Reconstruction will find familiar her exploration of how civil rights fared before the northern public.  Patriotic antislavery sentiment encouraged most northerners to see the freedmen as worthy Protestant individualists, who just wanted a chance at the American dream.  However, in Richardson's view, the grubby realities of Reconstruction rule eroded northern sympathy, especially the Radical Republican use of activist government to benefit the African-American masses.   In northern eyes, the freedpeople came to resemble the northern immigrants that sustained the corrupt Tweed ring, and a working class that was increasingly inclined toward trade unionism.  With the depression of the mid-1870s, national sentiment abandoned the costly commitment to protecting the freedmen's voting rights.  </p><p>It is here that the major motif of the book comes in, the <i>West from Appomattox</i> notion.  Richardson contends that as the southern scene soured, the tendency was to look toward an idealized west.  The celebration of the glories of Yosemite and Yellowstone, the cowboy mythology, the western dime novels; all fit with the general sense of an eroding society of individualists farther east.  Southerners distrustful of a big federal government were particularly drawn to this vision, as the novels <i>Shane</i> and <i>The Virginian</i> might suggest, but the appeal was national.  As Richardson observes, the western reality was far different, but the image would be of a rural land, the antithesis of confused, corrupt city life (118).  The book culminates in the ascension of Theodore Roosevelt, with his enthusiasm for western individualism and interest in conservation, which vividly encapsulates the book's themes.  It also illustrates the growing willingness of mainstream opinion to back a suitably domesticated form of Progressive anti-corporate reform by the turn of the century. </p><p>The west as a counterpoint to Reconstruction trauma is perhaps the book's major interpretive point, but the emphasis on respectable opinion does allow a number of other aspects into her synthesis.  The author argues that the reform agenda toward Native Americans, from Grant's peace policy to the Dawes act, fits in to this same emphasis on free labor individualism.   One might cite Protestant ethnocentrism as a more decisive factor, but the author's emphasis does not do violence to the evidence.  Similarly, the author effectively integrates the women's rights issue, especially the repackaging of women's rights from radical egalitarianism to social uplift, through settlement house efforts and the like.  As Richardson notes, This middle-class vision also limited women's role in society by basing their power on their positions as wives and mothers, not as independent, equal individuals (7).  But it did point to the incremental triumph of women's suffrage as part of the wider Progressive agenda.</p><p><i>West from Appomattox</i> offers readers a sensible approach to the late nineteenth century decades; she avoids the censorious tone so prevalent in Gilded Age studies.  Historians may not be particularly surprised by Richardson's findings, but discourse of the dominant classes does seem revealing, and the western angle is fresh.  There were, however, some aspects of the execution that might merit comment.  For the readers of this online publication, the first chapter on the Civil War will be of interest, but it has some detail issues.  I doubt that plantation owners were clustered mainly on the coastlands of . . . Mississippi, the geography here being imprecise (12).  Similarly, Sherman didn't devastate three hundred miles from Nashville to Savannah, Atlanta would seem the more relevant departure point, given the distance cited (16).  </p><p>There are more meaningful interpretive loose ends.  The author notes the similarity of recent election results with those of 1896, but with the parties reversed.  In 2004, red state voters who championed American individualism and blue state voters who recognized the limitation of that vision both reflected patterns established over a century ago (349).  It is a striking point, but it doesn't seem that connected to the larger interpretation, even considering President George W. Bush's evocation of his Texas origins.  The author spends a great deal of time on the mythic west, rather than engaging with how western developments concretely interacted with southern trends, like the departure of cavalry to fight Native Americans and the deployment of investment capital and government aid to the western railroads.  Furthermore, the author misses the opportunity to tie frontier vigilantism to the defense of southern lynching; press apologists relied heavily on the western precedents.  In general, there is less here about the southern states than one might expect, given the subtitle; after Redemption, Richardson's white southerners are tacitly absorbed into her narrative as mainstream Americans.  </p><p>The West is also vaguely defined as a concept, which is problematic because the farm frontier is precisely the area most prone to heterodox monetary ideas, activist government regulation of railroads, and radical third parties.  When Richardson talks about the idealized region, she is often talking about the sparsely-inhabited west, as opposed to the restive Granger-Greenbacker-Populist agrarian west where people generally lived.   Similarly, the author notes California's 1870s adventure in anti-corporate politics, but the anti-Chinese working class upsurge doesn't figure into the book's imagined west.  Nor is the mining frontier's attachment to the silver heresy and the Populist revolt.  Prosperous easterners were well aware of such western realities, but these inconvenient aspects get slighted in this book's argument.  </p><p>The author also has difficulty integrating the political narrative of the two parties with the emphasis on dominant opinion and its importance.   The strength of the book is the central focus on a mainstream consensus, but the fate of the two parties is not as integrated into this tale as a political historian might wish.  The topic is treated more as a side issue rather than something worthy of serious consideration.  Had the author done this more consistently, the book would be more effective as a synthesis.</p><p>These issues notwithstanding, this is an effective look at the era for a popular audience.  The author avoided portraying the era as one of abstract forces, in favor of emphasizing the experiences of a number of actual Americans (6).  The use of individual, recurring vignettes proves an effective narrative technique, and I at least found many of the individual stories novel and engaging.  The book might be well used as an undergraduate textbook for an upper level class.  Given the difficulties making the Gilded Age come alive for the wider public, this is a real accomplishment.</p><p> <i>Michl W.

3790|9780310000000|$26.95 hardcover|What This Cruel War Was Over: Soldiers, Slavery, and the Civil War|\N|Manning, Chandra|\N|\N|<h3>Why They Fought </h3><br><h3>Civil War Soldiers and Slavery</h3><p>Chandra Manning opens her enlightening and important book with three quotations. The first is from the regimental newspaper of the Thirteenth Wisconsin Infantry Regiment in February 1862: The Fact that slavery is the sole undeniable cause of this infamous rebellion, that it is a war of, by, and for Slavery, is as plain as the noon-day sun. The second is from the regimental newspaper of John Hunt Morgan's Confederate Brigade in November 1862: [A]ny man who pretends to believe that this is not a war for the emancipation of the blacks . . . is either a fool or a liar. The third is from the camp newspaper of the Fourteenth Rhode Island Heavy Artillery, a black regiment, in May 1864, on the black soldiers' obligations: [U]pon your prowess, discipline, and character; depend the destinies of four millions of people and the triumph of the principles of freedom and self-government of this great republic. For Manning, such samplings of soldiers' writing represent the fundamental fact that right from the beginning soldiers knew that the war was about slavery, which they understood not as an abstraction but, rather, as the actual enslavement of human beings in the United States based on race (3).</p><p>Manning makes a compelling case that the war was fought with pens as much as guns in a democratic society with few constraints on soldiers' writing home. Civil War soldiers wrote profusely not only about themselves but for themselves, so that reading their accounts of life in camp and battle promises rare insight into the real war as the soldiers understood it. To discover that understanding, Manning read widely in numerous archival collections of soldiers' diaries and correspondence and in runs of regimental newspapers (a source Civil War historians have surprisingly ignored). She includes a wide array of ordinary soldiers in her canvas?native-born and immigrant Union enlisted men, non-slaveholding and slaveholding Confederate soldiers, and black Union troops (mostly former slaves), and spreads her reach to embrace soldiers from the western theater in equal measure to the more studied armies in the eastern theater. In her research she found that soldiers wrote often and unabashedly about slavery. Rather than being ancillary to matters of states' rights, republican ideals, faith, and family, slavery went to the marrow of soldiers' thinking about the war's cause and consequence. </p><p>White Union enlisted men, Manning argues, opposed slavery from the beginning, even as they viewed blacks as inferior. They tried hard to separate the issues of slavery and black rights, but the more they saw of slavery in fact, the more they came not only to detest the institution but to empathize with the slave. White soldiers found the break-up of slave families and sexual abuses of slavery especially obnoxious and proof of slavery's corrupting effects on a supposedly Christian people who would tolerate such outrages. Seeing slavery up close made palpable all the antislavery images of a slave power and intensified soldiers' commitment to rid the country of the scourge and punish the slaveholders who had brought on the war with their arrogance and avarice. Significantly, by Manning's reckoning, Union soldiers marched in advance of their officers, political leaders, and civilians?save abolitionists?in pressing for a war of emancipation. They believed there could be no salvation of the Union without the elimination of slavery. Indeed, many soldiers thought that God was punishing America with war because of the sin of slavery.  </p><p>In the fulcrum year of 1861 to 1862, before Antietam and Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, Union soldiers used their letters home and their camp newspapers to lobby for emancipation that would liberate America by freeing it from all that slavery represented. Support for emancipation ebbed and flowed depending on battlefield fortunes (it was most ardent after Gettysburg), and Union soldiers from border slave states generally opposed emancipation and the use of black troops. Some soldiers also doubted the constitutionality of emancipation by executive order. But, overall, in Manning's estimation support for emancipation remained strong and sustained the Union war effort. Although Manning does not say so, the soldiers' push for emancipation no doubt helps explain their continued support for Lincoln as war president, a support that proved critical in 1864 when emancipation and the war's progress threatened Lincoln's re-election. Also, though Manning does not press the matter, such commitment to ending slavery likely also distanced soldiers from the home front, where emancipation was a more contentious issue. Gerald Linderman, among others, has argued that the hardening of soldiers to the horrors of war and demands of fighting alienated soldiers from the people at home who could not understand new definitions of courage and country forged from battle experience; perhaps, too, the soldiers' hatred of slavery made them different men than what their communities had sent off to war. If the Union soldiers did not agree on the extent of freedom to be accorded to blacks, they did agree that slavery was wrong and had to go. Many were willing, in the words of one soldier, to fight till hell freezes over, and then . . . cut the ice and fight on if necessary to end slavery in America (49).  </p><p>Blacks provided much of the impetus in converting antislavery sentiment into demands for emancipation. Slaves who encountered Union soldiers witnessed against slavery by the scars on their bodies, the stories of many abuses while in bondage, and their willingness to serve the Union cause. By joining the Union army, blacks showed their mettle. They found common cause in fighting to save the Union and redeem it from the sin of slavery. But blacks also came to expect more from freedom than did white soldiers, and such expectations proved soon enough more than the Union generally, could, or would, provide. For them, emancipation meant more than freedom from bondage; rather, it meant equal rights before the law, education, and voting. Manning does not follow the soldiers into Reconstruction to chart how they worked to realize the promise of freedom?a topic needful of more study?but she does imply that Union veterans were sympathetic to black aspirations even if they did not endorse them fully or do much directly to translate emancipation into freedom. </p><p>Confederate soldiers, Manning insists, were bound together by the shared belief in the dangers of abolition, which powerfully united Confederate soldiers and motivated them to fight, even when they shared little else (31). Defending slavery was at the root of the Confederacy's reason to exist and the common soldier's commitment to the cause. Even as onerous conscription policies, inflation, and impressment of farmers' produce and livestock eroded popular support for the Confederate war effort and led to many desertions, the common soldiers' fears of the consequences of defeat and the freeing of slaves kept them from quitting altogether. The chants about a rich man's war and a poor man's fight notwithstanding, white nonslaveholding southerners stood up for slavery. To their mind, the Union advance heralded their world turning upside down, much like Haiti, with rape and pillage following emancipation. When they fought to protect their hearth and home, it was not because Union armies were invading in a literal sense?though that came to be as the war progressed?but because Union armies invaded white privilege and racial hierarchy with the threat of abolition and all its attendant evils. For them, God demanded their defense of what they believed was a divinely sanctified way of life. For them, Manning writes, black slavery was vital to the protection of their families, interests, and very identities as men, and they relied on it to prevent race war (39). Thus, Manning concludes that slavery, [f]ar from splintering Confederates along class lines, provided the cement that held Confederates together even under almost trying circumstances (6). The Union's resort to using black troops further hardened white southerners' in the conviction of a diabolical abolitionist North bent on the complete destruction of southern society and Christian order. Simply put, whites of all classes feared a loss of mastery should slavery end. </p><p>Anyone who has read soldiers' diaries and letters to any extent?that is, the soldiers' immediate thoughts and concerns unfiltered by memory and postwar experience?will likely agree with her emphasis on slavery as what this cruel war was over. Her use of regimental newspapers should make even doubters agree that slavery superseded all other reasons for why soldiers fought. Indeed, because the question of slavery stood at the center of mid-nineteenth-century Americans' efforts to define what the republic was and ought to be, and even of what God expected of them and their country, the surprise is not that soldiers fixed on slavery but that so many students of the Civil War have not. Manning's book might not persuade the most rabid advocates of states' rights as the cause and rationale for the war to rethink their conviction in light of what the soldiers actually wrote, and it might not convince those who insist that soldiers fought on because of comradeship rather than commitments to ideas about liberty, republicanism, or even God's favor. But her book should cause every student of the war to read the soldiers' words on their terms, as she has done, and let them have them have the last word.</p><p><i>Randall M.

3791|9780810000000|$39.95 hardcover|William Lowndes Yancey and the Coming of the Civil War|\N|Walther, Eric H.|\N|\N|<h3>Alabama's Leading Fire-Eater</h3><br><p>William Lowndes Yancey of Alabama is probably best known for orchestrating the destruction of the Democratic Party in 1860.  In leading the southern delegation out of the Charleston Convention that year, Yancey helped ensure the election of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency, an outcome that precipitated the secession of the Deep South.  How could one man have had such a dramatic effect on the fate of the nation?  In his meticulously researched biography, Eric Walther answers this question, presenting a nuanced image of a leader who exemplified the core values of the antebellum South: honor, white supremacy, and states' rights.  Having studied the secessionist mentality in his book <i>The Fire-Eaters</i> (1992), Walther considers Yancey perhaps the most important southern radical of the 1850s.  As an active, pro-slavery politico who excelled at oratory, Yancey not only kept his fellow southerners constantly apprised of a looming northern threat to slavery, but excited his listeners with visions of an achievable southern nation.</p><p>In his first chapters, Walther describes Yancey's upbringing and stresses its impact on the man's eventual radicalism.  The tale here is a formative competition between two patriarchs: Benjamin Yancey, the loving biological father of Yancey's preadolescence in Georgia, whose heroic exploits in the navy epitomized southern valor; and Nathan Beman, the stern, abusive stepfather of Yancey's teenage years in New York, whose seemingly self-righteous abolitionism personified a hypocritical North.  The combined influence produced an adult who was highly opinionated yet privately insecure.  In editing newspapers, pursuing law, and engaging in politics, Yancey sought public venues where he could express his ideas with boldness and receive immediate feedback.</p><p>The bulk of Walther's biography examines Yancey's role as the chief architect of secession.  A nationalist in his youth, Yancey eventually embraced the ideology of states' rights.  This transformation occurred after he moved to Alabama, where that state's defiant individualism appealed to Yancey's militant sense of honor.  Like other ambitious Southerners, Yancey realized that in the land of cotton states rights and slavery were intertwined: to extol one was to defend the other.  As a Congressman in the mid-1840s, Yancey wholeheartedly supported American expansion as imperative for the continued power of the slave states.</p><p>According to Walther, Yancey's secessionist outlook really began in 1848.  Convinced that the Wilmot Proviso (which called for the prohibition of slavery in all territory acquired during the Mexican War) was the opening salvo in an emergent northern campaign to destroy the peculiar institution, Yancey promulgated his so-called Alabama Platform.  This manifesto essentially both rejected the authority of the Federal government to ever interfere with slavery and proscribed politicians who thought otherwise.  As Walther points out, the platform became for Yancey the key to southern salvation (106).  When southerners repudiated the platform as uncompromising, an angry Yancey supported in 1850-1852 a stillborn effort at secession.  In the aftermath of these setbacks, he changed tactics.  Rather than coerce his reluctant southern brethren with diatribes, Yancey would educate them with reasoned appeals, thereby spreading what Walther describes as the Leaven of Disunion.  By the election of 1860, growing tension over slavery had so polarized the political atmosphere that Yancey now enjoyed a win-win situation: either the Federal government endorsed the Alabama Platform or the South would secede.  At Alabama's secession convention in January 1861, Yancey dispensed with his didactic methods and excoriated those delegates who still hesitated; the marginalized voice in 1850 now expressed the popular will.</p><p>The last chapters discuss Yancey's contributions to the Confederacy.  As the head diplomat to Britain and France in 1861, Yancey tried to gain recognition for his new country, performing credibly at what ultimately proved a futile task.  And as a senator in the Confederate Congress, Yancey strived to balance the people's liberty with military exigency, as demonstrated by his qualified support for conscription.</p><p>The main strength of Walther's biography is the author's careful analysis of Yancey's rather sophisticated political outlook.  Yancey was not only a great speaker, but a skillful essayist; through both mediums he was often acerbic and bombastic, but he was no mere demagogue.  Rather, Yancey was a shrewd propagandist whose public discourse presented a compelling rationale for southern revolution.  Playing to notions of honor, Yancey consistently reminded Southerners that the North was the principal aggressor through its unwarranted scrutiny of southern culture, which he claimed it deemed inferior, and through its imperious demands for the South to change.  In short, Yancey deftly reversed the abolitionist rhetoric about a slave power conspiracy by proclaiming the rise of an anti-slave power, particularly the nascent Republican Party, which sought to subvert the South's equality within the Union.  Similarly, Walther emphasizes Yancey's steadfast defense of slavery from a standpoint of power, not morality, a practice that kept the focus on the South's supposedly precarious political future.  In fact, Yancey refused to address the moral question, partly because white supremacy rendered the matter irrelevant, but primarily because he rightly understood that doing so allowed abolitionists to define the terms of the debate.  Finally, Yancey frequently invoked the Founding Fathers in the context of an oppressed minority and the right of revolution.  As the author notes, Yancey reassured uncertain southerners that the Union was a means to protect their liberty, but not an end in itself (144).  Thus, Yancey candidly let everyone know that rebellion was an acceptable course.</p><p>Another noteworthy feature of Walther's work is its portrayal of Yancey as a multi-dimensional figure.  Too often the fire-eaters are viewed as mean-spirited extremists.  But Walther's Yancey comes across as a doting family man, whose concern for his sons during the Civil War is touching.  Yancey also displayed a laudable progressive streak, promoting public education and prison reform.  Though hardly a gender egalitarian, he evinced respect for women who spoke their mind.  Yancey even condemned the xenophobic Know-Nothing movement in Alabama, arguing that hostility toward Catholic immigrants was antithetical to religious freedom.  Still, Yancey was a slaveholder, one who viewed blacks not from the familiar perspective of paternalism, but from a purely utilitarian point of view: slaves were obedient chattel that both served a vital labor function and preserved the social order of racial hierarchy.</p><p>There are two matters of concern with Walther's appraisal of Yancey.  The first is the author's awkward caveat on page 2 of his intention to use modern psychology to explain Yancey's rebellious behavior.  Everyone knows that childhood experiences shape personality; a biographer need not draw undue attention to those times the main character is on the couch, so to speak.  Walther's references to Yancey's search for an approving father figure, for instance, unwittingly suggest that the man was driven more by his neuroses than by his principles.  And Yancey's specific state of mind does not account for the motivation of those secessionists who grew up under different circumstances.  It would have been better had Walther simply integrated his psychoanalysis into the narrative without advertising the practice.</p><p>The second concern is one inherent in any study of a famous person, namely the extent to which an individual influences surrounding events.  Walther clearly insists that Yancey played a decisive role in shaping the climate of secession, yet hundreds if not thousands of other southerners in and beyond Alabama were similarly inclined toward radical action.  Historian William L. Barney, in <i>The Secessionist Impulse: Alabama and Mississippi in 1860</i> (1974), barely mentions Yancey in his persuasive socioeconomic explanation for why Alabama seceded from the Union.  Rather than steering the South toward secession, perhaps Yancey is significant because he articulated more cogently than any of his peers the nature of a revolution already in motion.  Still, in a crisis all people look toward their leaders for guidance and hope; and Yancey certainly provided both.</p><p>These criticisms in no way undermine the value of Walther's scholarship or the importance of his book.  <i>William Lowndes Yancey and the Coming of the Civil War</i> is an outstanding work that illuminates in thorough detail, and with insightful commentary, the life and times of man who stood at the center of the sectional conflict.  Eric Walther has established Yancey as a champion of southern rights second only to John C. Calhoun.</p><p><i>Ben H. Severance is an assistant professor of history at Auburn University Montgomery.

Robert Tracy McKenzie challenges this received wisdom in his nuanced study of Knoxville between 1861 and 1865.  McKenzie demonstrates that Knoxville was an anomaly in this largely rural and mountainous section of the state.  Situated at the confluence of several rivers, this early capital of Tennessee had long been the commercial center for that region of the country.  The addition of railroads before the war insured that this small city?with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants in 1860?would retain its preeminent position.  Additionally as the home of the educational institution that would become the University of Tennessee, Knoxville was a diverse community.</p><p>This diversity became its hallmark during the secession crisis and the war that followed.  A relatively broad spectrum of political positions did not lead to accommodation and compromise.  Newspaper editor William G. Brownlow made sure of that.  Brownlow, an outspoken partisan in politics and a Unionist, was not content to enunciate his positions with clarity.  He specialized in the use of personal invective that lacerated his opponents.  They were unwilling to remain passive targets and replied in kind.  The result was a rather acrimonious public sphere into which all of the stresses of a civil war were thrust.  McKenzie points out that Brownlow's national prominence and gift for colorful language has led many scholars to assume that he spoke for the entire community and region.  But his careful analysis of the city's political landscape throughout the conflict demonstrates that this was incorrect before the Union Army arrived in 1863 and large numbers of Confederates fled from Knoxville.</p><p>Drawing upon his previous research for <i>One South or Many?  Plantation Belt and Upcountry in Civil War-Era Tennessee</i> (2002), McKenzie carefully distinguishes between elite activities and the concerns voiced by the middle and lower classes.  By using the abundant sources available, McKenzie has determined the location of known Confederate and Unionist households in the city.  He documents the fact that partisans from both sides were distributed in all sections of the community and found among all classes.  The result was that virtually everyone's political allegiance was recognized by their neighbors and often known throughout the city.  Despite the overwhelming opposition to secession recorded in the city, old political divisions appeared soon after secession became a fact.</p><p>Aware that the secession vote had demonstrated a strong anti-Confederate feeling among many voters in the city, Confederate military leaders sought to conciliate the local population.  For their part, committed Unionists either left?including Brownlow?or offered no overt opposition to the new government.  This unofficial neutrality was tolerated until a small number of Unionists participated in a railroad bridge-burning spree that prompted Richmond authorities to demand a harsher policy.  The truce definitely ended when the Confederacy instituted conscription in 1862.  Local Confederate commanders sought but failed to have East Tennessee exempted from the draft.  This action drove nearly one hundred Unionists into the Federal Army and encouraged others who remained behind to join clandestine anti-Confederate forces.  Unionists who remained found themselves forced to provide material support to the Confederacy despite personal misgivings.</p><p>The advance of the Union Army under General Ambrose Burnside in 1863 and the subsequent uncontested occupation of Knoxville completely changed the partisan dynamic.  Many Confederates fled the city?including virtually the entire leadership cadre.  Many Unionist exiles returned, including the vengeful Brownlow.  Now the Confederate citizens found themselves victims of the seizure of their property and its subsequent destruction.  The advance of a Confederate Army under General James Longstreet placed everyone in the city under duress.  McKenzie is justifiably critical of Longstreet's vigor and strategy during the extended confrontation that followed.  With the forced retreat of Longstreet's army, Knoxville's anti-Unionists were at the mercy of their foes.</p><p>In the concluding section of this trenchant study, McKenzie traces the divisions among the Unionists.  Although regional leaders gained unparalleled prominence?Andrew Johnson was elected vice president in 1864 and became president in April 1865 and Brownlow was elected governor by a restricted electorate?the winning coalition split apart over the issues of emancipation and African-American rights.  Conservative Unionists refused to support Brownlow and the anti-Confederates that joined the Republican Party.  The division was made permanent as many of the more aggressive Unionists sought to use local and Federal courts to gain recompense for their financial losses from their former enemies.  Other former Confederates stood trial in court for illegal activities during the war.  While few of these actions provided much satisfaction to the Unionists, the cases insured that wartime animosities would continue unabated.  McKenzie concludes his analysis with a brief description of the postwar political and social developments in this divided city.</p><p>This brief summary cannot do justice to McKenzie's sophisticated narrative and interpretation.  It goes into much greater depth about developments in Knoxville than does Noel C. Fisher's <i>War at Every Door:  Partisan Politics and Guerrilla Violence in East Tennessee, 1860-1869</i> (1997).  Like the Fisher study, McKenzie's book disputes the stereotype of unchallenged Unionism in the region.  By being able to identify many of the individuals caught in this nightmare and to be able to assign allegiances to them, McKenzie allows the reader to follow the changing perceptions and actions of the participants in this drama.  This is the book's greatest contribution.  Although McKenzie is more than willing to draw his own conclusions, he provides the reader with sufficiently detailed information that the reader can analyze the data and agree or disagree.</p><p>This study is an important addition to our understanding of the Civil War in the Appalachian South.  As McKenzie clearly demonstrates, allegiance in this contested borderland was complex and unstable. This was particularly the case in urban areas that had a diversified economy and population.  While events and developments in Knoxville were unique in some important ways, McKenzie's broader findings are applicable to the entire region.  These include the fact that both Confederate and Unionist populations were not united and often differed profoundly on fundamental questions and strategies.  In addition, the bitterness that developed within the civilian population was often based on antebellum divisions and was intensely personal.  Finally, reconciliation after the war was difficult and animosities lingered for years?even decades in some instances.  It appears unlikely to this reviewer that this study will be superseded unless some new cache of documents is uncovered.  These broad findings are part of a growing consensus of scholars of the region, and McKenzie's book will insure that this interpretation will be accorded even greater credibility.</p><p><i>Gordon McKinney is Professor of History and Director of the Appalachian Center at Berea College.

3793|\N|\N|<p>CIVIL WAR TREASURES: </p>Facing the Enemy<br>Planter's diary outlines daily struggle with occupation|\N|Jewett, Leah Wood|\N|\N|Collection: John C. Elder diary, Mss. 4353, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries, Baton Rouge, La. Size: 1 item.<h3>New Acquisitions in the </h3><h3>Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections</h3><h3>LSU Libraries' Special Collections</h3><br><p>As in many diaries of the day, the early pages of John Carroll Elder's journal are filled with reports on the weather, crop planting, and day to day activities such as attending church. In spite of the start of hostilities between North and South one year before, his life was apparently affected little by fighting in the East. Though Elder's entries are short on details, they successfully convey a Confederate planter's experience in war.</p><p><blockquote>February 23</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>To church at 7 o'clock. Godfather for Caroline.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>February 24</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>6 Ploughing and [illegible]. Ned grinding corn.  Austin and women breaking corn. Dry wind from North.</blockquote></p><p>But when the Crescent City fell to Union hands in April 1862, everything changed.</p><p>Forty nine year-old John Carroll Elder, a native of Maryland, was a planter in East Baton Rouge Parish at the outbreak of the Civil War. At the time of the 1860 census, Elder's real estate value is listed as $30,000; personal property totaled $20,500. Sixteen slaves, ages one to 50, lived and worked on his plantation. Based on Elder's references, it is likely that cotton was the principal crop.  His property was located along the Mississippi River, a few miles north of downtown Baton Rouge near the modern community of Scotlandville (site of historically black institution, Southern University). He was probably Catholic, as his wife, Mary Elizabeth Duffel, is buried in the Catholic Cemetery associated with St. Joseph's Church (later a cathedral) in Baton Rouge, and the Catholic Church is the only one specifically mentioned in his diary.</p> <p>Elder records Union activity along the river and in the capital city from the first days of occupation. The April 25 entry?the day before the Union capture of New Orleans?refers to his efforts to hide cotton from the enemy (no doubt in response to Governor Thomas Overton Moore's order for citizens to destroy the crop to keep it from falling into enemy hands). In May, Elder witnesses the arrival of Union troops in a variety of naval vessels, including the gunboats. Intertwined with his reports of ships and Federal soldiers, Elder notes that plowing, planting, and the children's blackberry picking continues.</p><p><blockquote>May 4</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>I burn cotton in gin. Gunboats coming up...</blockquote></p><p>General Benjamin Butler's Order No. 29 banning the use of Confederate paper currency is mentioned, followed by a description of the bombardment of Baton Rouge:</p><p><blockquote>May 28</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Capt. Farragut Bombarded Baton Rouge.{1} Women and children running, the road crowded with them...burning shells struck the Catholic church and other building with grapeshot.</blockquote></p><p>Elder describes his many encounters with the enemy, who search his property, attempt to force him to take the oath of allegiance to the United States, steal crops and livestock from him, and harass his neighbors. Area residents did their best to hide valuable crops and livestock from the enemy. The presence of Federal soldiers in the area brought the war home to the Elder family: </p><p><blockquote>June 3</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Gun boat stopped before the house and 1000 men with 6 pieces [of] artillery came on the plantation to see if there were any guerillas...Col. Payne commanding. </blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 4</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Meet men up the road and concluded we could do nothing with pop guns against cannon and Enfield rifles. Heard we whipped the enemy at Richmond. Killed 2 rabbits.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 5</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Met 10 Guerillas back of field. Visited Mr. Blunt with Elizabeth. Negroes scraping sweet potatoes, planting corn.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 6</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Six thousand soldiers in Baton Rouge. One ship, 4 gunboats sail full of runaway negroes. [Soldiers] rob Birds Plantation of corn, meat milk poultry.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 8 (S)</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Did not go to church because the enemy were in Baton Rouge.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 15 (S)</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Stayed at home, the enemy in Baton Rouge. Ten mortar and gunboats...to Vicksburg. Enemy took Ludlow's horses.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 17</blockquote><p><blockquote>Gunboat and 2 mortar boats. A. Williams{2} negroes say that he and son were shot and buried in the levee.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 18</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Plowing corn and cane hoeing pota[toe]s. Six enemy came to Williams Plantation, order[ed] the negroes to go to work.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 20</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>...All boats left for Vicksburg.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 21</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>...Enemy put handcuffs on Mr. Gee, broke his trunk open and gave his clothes to the negroes of A.A. Williams.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 22 (S) </blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Enemy took Bogel's Cotton. Fed their horses and men, about 35 of them asked me to take the oath of allegiance. I refused. Enemy arrived at 11 o'clock at night. At sunrise came to my house, the servants [were] all crying with fear. Kept Latile in room till evening.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 26</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Enemy taking Mr. Bogel's cotton on the ferry boat... left 15 bales at landing.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 28 </blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Gravellin had wagon loaded with Bogel's Cotton. Had it put back to bayou.</blockquote></p><p>In an attempt to retake Louisiana for the Confederacy, General Earl Van Dorn sent troops to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to engage the enemy. Opposing forces met in the capital city on August 5. Elder outlines measures taken by his family to leave their home after receiving word that Van Dorn had ordered an evacuation of the area in anticipation of fighting.</p><p><blockquote>July 1</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Gen.Van Dorn's proclamation ordering every one to move 8 miles east of river. My family [is] busy packing up trunk and boxes.</blockquote></p><p>In general as the Union army advanced, slaves took notice, and work levels dropped significantly. Historians note many instances in which slaves who stayed behind on the plantation assisted arriving Union soldiers in locating the hidden valuables of slaveholders. Many left the relative safety of the plantation seeking uncertain freedom for themselves and their families among the soldiers in blue. Elder reports the waves of departure as slaves from neighboring areas begin to leave:</p><p><blockquote>July 10</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Ned left last night with Taylor's negro Mose in a skiff. Drove 21 head of cows and calves over to Devil Swamp. Taylor's negro child died. Baptized two negro children of Taylor's. Five negroes left of Judge Favrot's. Heard Blanchard was taken prisoner.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>July 11</blockquote><p><blockquote>Flat boat of negroes left LeBlanc. Twenty five of A.A. Williams's negroes left.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>July 14</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>To Baton Rouge with Mrs. Taylor to look for negroes.  At bank received note 80 ? Gov. Shepland{3} told him of Russell and [that] armed men came and took my cotton by force. He had the commander Gen. McMillan to give me an order for any cotton which I stored in Capt. Payne's warehouse. Governor said to the officers --do you supply citizens with armed men to steal? Got a pass for one week</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>July 16</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Remained all night in Baton Rouge at the priest's house. Engage the police officers to look for Ned, Sam and Mose.</blockquote></p><p>Throughout the occupation Elder and his neighbors are plagued by the federal requisitioning of their property. In this instance, Elder makes note of the commanding officer and the regiment involved:</p><p><blockquote>July 28</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Got home at 12 o'clock. Lt. Grimstead of 21st Indiana regiment4 came with a company of armed men and took on boat 11 head [of] cattle, 1 sheep, chickens and 30 watermelons.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>August 5</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Battle [of] Baton Rouge.</blockquote></p><p>Once Federal troops focused their attention on Vicksburg, the citizens of Baton Rouge were able to function somewhat normally, as Elder indicates in subsequent entries:</p><p><blockquote>Undated</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>The enemy left Baton Rouge about the middle August. They took 13 bales of my cotton to New Orleans.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>October 16</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Received payment of 13 bales of cotton in New Orleans.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>October 21</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Negroes gathering corn.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>October 22</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>To Baton Rouge with Taylor. [Had] my hair cut. Brother Tom [is] very sick.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>October 24 </blockquote></p><p><blockquote>To Devil's Swamp with [illegible]; seen 1 sow and pig, 1 cow and calf.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>October 25</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Turned very cold and windy.</blockquote></p><p>Elder closes his diary with A list of articles taken or destroyed on John C. Elder Plantation from 13 to 20th March 1863 By the Federal soldiers of the United States Army. Among the items listed: 14 mules, 2 horses, 1 mare, 10 cows, 10 calves, 4 oxen, 3 sows, 20 pigs, 19 turkeys, 70 chickens, plates, saucers, cooking utensils, harnesses, saddles, a grindstone, animal fodder hatchets, and one silver thimble. He notes that the soldiers also broke the stove, damaged the cabin door and destroyed the corn house. He estimated the property's total worth at $5,472. Union confiscation and/or destruction of the property belonging to Confederate civilians was commonplace; it is likely that Elder's neighbors suffered similar damage. </p><p>The details of Elder's life after the war are unknown, save the fact that his wife died in 1867. John Carroll Elder died in Baton Rouge on August 7, 1900. Though it offers no specific details of his life, the obituary in the <i>Daily Advocate</i> describes Elder as one of the oldest and most respected citizens of this parish and a member of one of the most historical families in the country.  While there is little supplemental documentation of his life in the historical record, his diary stands as a testament to one man's trials on the Confederate homefront.</p><p>Note: Grammar, spelling, and punctuation of the original diary text has been standardized for this article.</p>--------------------<p>1. Alfred A. Williams owned property adjacent to, and across the river from Elder; the property is highlighted in blue in Persac's 1858 map. </p><p>2.

Printed in the Official Records of Union and Confederate Navies, Series I Volume 18 (pp. 515-516) the original letters exchanged between Admiral David Farragut and the Vice Consul of France are within the holdings of the Special Collections. </p><p>Transcriptions of the letters follow:</p><p><br>Officer of Vice Consul of France</br><br>Baton Rouge, LA</br><br>May 28, 1862</br></p><p><br>Commodore Farragut</br><br>Commanding U. S. Navy</br><br>Off Baton Rouge</br></p><p>Sir</p><p>In the temporary absence of the mayor of Baton Rouge and in the recess of the council of the same city, I am requested and authorized by the citizens to inform you that the attack which was made on one of your small boats this morning, and the subsequent firing on one of your vessels, were made by a troop of mounted men from the country.</p><p>The citizens, therefore, wish that the city may not be held responsible, and thousands of unprotected women and children exposed to the dangers of a cannonade and bombardment and driven from their homes, on consequence of proceedings which they could not control. As early as possible, no doubt, the authorities or the citizens will send a communication to the commander of the rangers, urging him to avoid compromising the safety of the women and children and the security of the property of the city, by skirmishing with your forces within the corporate limits. In the meanwhile it is hoped and expected that hereafter should you deem it proper to cannonade or bombard the city you will give timely notice for the withdrawal of the women and children and all noncombatants. </p><p>With high respect</p><p><br>I [illegible], Sir</br><br>your obt. serv.</br><br>L.

I felt assured at the time that it must be the act of some lawless band. As I had received every assurance from the mayor and Council, and even from many of the citizens of Baton Rouge that every effort would be made by them to preserve order and prevent any overt act that might in any way compromise their town. Hence you may easily imagine my surprise at the salutation we received this morning ? notwithstanding the provocation, however, I did everything in my power to avoid the destruction of either life or property of the citizens of Baton Rouge ? I endeavored as far as practicable to inflict the punishment where it was due. Should there be no further attack upon us there will be no necessity for my firing upon the town, but, I cannot promise that when attacked I will not return the fire, but you may be assured that if time and opportunity is given you shall have due notice for the removal of the women and children.</p><p>I am,</p><p><br>Very respectfully</br><br>Your Obedient Servant.</br><br>D.

5335|978-1-4262-0874-4|$30.00 |Shiloh 1862|\N|Groom, Winston|\N|\N|<h3>Rewriting the Shiloh Narrative</h3><br><p>For those coming to the subject of the Shiloh Campaign for the first time, readers will find in <i>Shiloh 1862</i> an accessible, highly skilled, readable introduction to this perennially fascinating operation. Winston Graham has obviously found the high drama, colour, intrinsic excitement and appalling suffering of the Civil War ideal material for his books, as he is recently the author of <i>Vicksburg 1863</i> (2009) as well. His book is fashioned in a highly professional manner: the chapters are cleverly arranged and neither too long nor too short. He also shapes his material so that the doings of the great personalities do not crowd out the experience of the men in the ranks. Groom is also alert to the links between seemingly minor events and the mishaps that take their place in the mighty chain of great events. For instance, he writes about a patrol led by Major James E. Powell of the 25th Missouri Infantry, who in the dark stumbled on William J. Hardees Corps of 10,000 men.  He writes this savage little fight at last touched off what was to be thus far the bloodiest battle in American military history. It would be remembered as the most brutal battle in the West during the entire Civil War (69). Groom manages to capture the atmosphere of such encounters and adds telling detail. He has an eye for an apt turn of phrase that captures the topography in the minds eye. Pittsburg Landing he sums up as a nondescript hog-and-cotton loading station perched before tall oak-strewn bluffs where steamboats put in from time to time (40).</p><p>On the controversial issues that surround the campaign, Mr. Groom offers little new insight, but instead a judicious summary of the consensus of recent scholarship. He agrees that the success attained by the initial Confederate onslaught cannot be explained away: great blame attaches to Grant and to a lesser extent Sherman for creating a state of mind determined to continue the Union advance come what may rather than defend what had already been taken (62). As Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman played such a large part in the eventual defeat of the Confederacy, they have been the subject of both fierce denunciation and an equally stout defence. Groom is probably right that Shermans gruff manner before the battle resulted from his overcompensating for accusations made four months previously that he was insane and a nervous Nellie (59).  Grants boss, Major General Henry W. Halleck, who nursed doubts about his subordinates abilities, had issued an order that he should entrench which Grant found reasons to ignore. Grant had also been ordered to wait for the arrival of Don Carlos Buells Army of the Ohio, marching to Pittsburg Landing from Nashville. This last order Grant obeyed to the letter, but he assumed, Groom avers, that the enemy might be so obliging as to do what he expected, that is, remain on the defensive, and this seemed to create a kind of blindness even as the evidence of danger mounted (63). Grooms harsh verdict should not mislead readers to expect undue Confederate sympathy, far from it. As the Lost Cause tradition requires an image of Grant lolling in a permanent state of drunken stupor, Groom with a sharp rebuke dismisses the silly <i>canard</i> that Grant was intoxicated as the battle opened. 6 April, he affirms, was shaping up to be the most trying [day] ever of Grants long and illustrious military career, and one thing for certain is that a drunkard could never have made his way through it (74).</p><p>The sheer gruesome unpleasantness of the fighting and the shock felt by all participants is well conveyed in Grooms account of the fighting for the Hornets Nest. The Confederate commander, Albert Sidney Johnston, committed ten brigades to take this ground of dubious tactical value. It also cost him his life, because the 45th Tennessee Infantry had refused to advance and Johnston had offered to lead them himself. A bullet hit an artery, he ignored the wound, and he expired by 2:45 pm. His deputy, P.G.T. Beauregard, took over but failed to grip the battle and later in the evening called off the Confederate attack, setting the stage for Grants counter-stroke the following day.</p><p>If Grooms book has a weakness, it is too long in relation to the material used. There is too much background, on the wars coming, on earlier operations, and the potted biographies of leading figures are too detailed. Although there are switches in time back and forth, Grooms account of the battle only begins in earnest after 200 pages have been turned. Still, for those who luxuriate in the detail, they will find much to enjoy here.</p><p><i>Brian Holden Reid is Professor of American History and Military Institutions and Academic Member of Council, Kings College London, England, and the author of</i> Americas Civil War: The Operational Battlefield, 1861-1863 <i>(2008).</i></p>|Reid, Brian Holden|Winter 2013|2/1/2013|Review|\N|\N|National Geographic|\N|Battles;Military|\N|\N|"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=242 alt=\Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/Shiloh1862.jpg\"">"""|\N
5336|978-0-307-59269-9|$30 .00|A Wicked War: Polk, Clay, Lincoln, and the 1846 U.S. Invasion of Mexico|\N|Greenberg, Amy S.|\N|\N|<h3>A New Approach to the Mexican-American War</h3><br><p>Amy S. Greenbergs <i>A Wicked War</i> provides an unusual synthesis of the U.S. - Mexican War by interweaving five biographies, with some six degrees of separation interconnections among them, through a narrative, beginning with the U.S. annexation of Texas and ending with the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. Presumably, the books title omits two of these key protagonistsJohn J. Hardin, the former U.S. congressman from Illinois who served as colonel of the First Illinois and died at the battle of Buena Vista, and Nicholas P. Trist, the Department of State chief clerk who negotiated the war-ending treatybecause they are unknown to the general reading public compared to Clay, Lincoln and Polk and because naming all five would have made the title unwieldy.</p> <p>Greenbergs title, from Mexican War lieutenant U.S. Grants 1879 regret that he had not had resigned his commission rather than serve in as wicked a war as ever waged, sets Greenbergs revisionist thesis and tonethat the Mexican War, for all its U.S. triumphs and vast land acquisitions, was more unpopular than conventional historiography would have it. Arguing that the fighting generated Americas first national antiwar movement, Greenberg references the wars famous dissenters like abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison and transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau but mostly makes her case experientially by chronologically tracing her principal characters through the war (xvi).</p> <p>Henry Clay, who lost his presidential race in 1844 by miscalculating the Texas issue and sacrificed his son, a colonel, in the wartime battle of Buena Vista, laid low with his simmering antiwar instincts during the early going, when the conflict was most popular, but went public in dissent with a speech before thousands in his hometown of Lexington, Kentucky on November 13, 1847. The speech killed his remaining chances of being president but ignited antiwar rallies from Indiana to New Jersey, Kentucky to Maine (236). Congressman-elect Lincoln, visiting his wifes family in Lexington at the time of Clays oration, was profoundly affected by Clays message, and soon afterwards took his famous antiwar stance in the U.S. House of Representatives, appropriating words and ideas directly from Henry Clays Lexington address (249). Lincolns attack on Polk, Greenberg discovers from her exhaustive newspaper research, got far more national attention than scholars acknowledge.</p> <p>President Polk never would have given Trist his diplomatic mission had he comprehended that Trist, despite superficial expansionist credentials, harbored an innate distrust of war and was unsuited for an assignment designed to swallow up all or most of Mexico (93). Eventually, Trist concluded that Americans should be ashamed of what he considered a war of aggression and he pursued a peace treaty with as minimal a land cession by Mexico that his superiors in Washington might tolerate. Hardin was a martial spirit expansionist when he took command of the First Illinois volunteer regiment in 1846, but became convinced by his war service that Mexicans were a miserable race no more deserving of U.S. citizenship than American Indians (151). Though Hardin never renounced the war, he turned against annexing Mexico and antiwar critics manipulated the news of his death to their own ends. Antiwar resistance, in turn, helped convince President James K. Polk, whose health disintegrated from wartime overwork, that he had better accept Trists treaty, even though it gained far less of Mexico than he wanted. The antiwar movement even drives the conflicts secondary placement in historical memory. Greenbergs epilogue suggests that Americans by the late nineteenth century had become collectively so ashamed by what their nation had done to Mexico that they mostly wanted to forget it.</p>  <p>Greenbergs important though challengeable secondary argument is that Polks abolitionist critics had it right, that the president provoked the war <i>primarily</i> to expand slavery. Polk never explicitly said this to his cabinet or in his diary, and some scholars, notably Norman A. Graebner in his classic <i>Empire on the Pacific</i> (1955), have argued the president mostly went to war because he coveted California ports for the China trade. Following the interpretation of William Dusineberres <i>Slavemaster President</i> (2003), however, Greenberg presents Polk as desperate for new slave states to shore up the Souths labor system and captive to attitudes originating in his personal slaveholdings (37). One of her most provocative related arguments is that Illinoiss distinctive enthusiasm for the war (it contributed more volunteers for the army than any state but Missouri) had less to do with its frontier-like western identity than with its quasi-slavery indentured labor system and how close it came to being a slave state itself.</p><p>A third theme darting here and there through the narrative, foreshadowed in such works as Richard Slotkins <i>Fatal Environment</i> (1985) and Reginald Horsmans <i>Race and Manifest Destiny</i> (1985), is that comprehending American aggression against Mexico demands an understanding of aggressive instincts fostered by the entire past history of how white Americans related to and battled with Native Americans. Would John Hardin have been less expansionist had his namesake grandfather not been an Indian killer involved in almost every action against Indians between 1786 and 1791 in the Ohio Territory? Would U.S. volunteer soldiers have committed so many atrocities against Mexican civilians had they not instinctively conflated Mexicans with blacks and Indians (52)? Sometimes Greenbergs musings about Indians, though, beg amplification. She mentions, for example, that Sam Houston believed Mexicans are no better than Indians, without exploring how those feelings might have related to Houstons earlier personal experiences after he resigned his governorship of Tennessee and took up an extended residence among Cherokees in the Indian Territory (57).</p> <p>As might be expected given the thrust of Greenbergs previous scholarship, <i>Wicked War</i> gives more play to gender than do other syntheses of the U.S.-Mexican War. She argues <i>both</i> that women played a more important role in the war than is commonly realized and that wartime politics, soldiering, and discourse were framed by gendered perspectives about manliness and honor. Greenberg provocatively suggests that the Mexican War merits labeling as Mr. and Mrs. Polks War because of the presidents wife, Sarah (xv). A genuine political partner to James K. Polk, Sarah Polk was expected to read and interpret newspapers and political debates for him and even to write his political correspondence. Greenberg also has much to say about Mary Todd Lincoln, John J. Hardins female relations, women who turned antiwar such as the youthful Jane Swisshelm of Pittsburg (who broke gender conventions by publishing antiwar editorials under her own name), and the sexual fantasies of pro-annexation politicians and soldiers who believed that Americans could prepare their invaded neighbor for annexation by Anglo-Saxonizing it through marriages. Such fantasies, she emphasizes, played out in cheap pot-boiling novelettes like Charles Averills <i>The Mexican Ranchero</i>.</p>  <p>A master historian/writer who enriches her narrative with compelling quotations, clever turns-of-phase, and arresting word portraits, Greenberg begins her account by introducing Henry Clay and the Texas question in the context of how Valentines Day was celebrated in the 1840s and sustains her narrative throughout with fascinating descriptions and anecdotes. Her accounts of politics in Washington and soldiering in the field are equally deft, and she nicely recreates reactions to the war on the home front, especially after reports of casualties arrived or veterans returned. A product of exhaustive research in primary and secondary sources, including many manuscript collections, <i>Wicked War</i> benefits from an unusually wise selection of maps and illustrations, superior image captions, and a first-class index with very helpful sub-headings.</p> <p><i>Wicked War</i> falls just short of its book jacket hype of being the definitive history of the 1846 conflict. Greenberg, as she notes in her introduction, prioritizes some aspects of the war more than others. Readers searching for in-depth analyses of tactics, weaponry, the U.S. naval blockade and riverine operations, and minor operations removed from Hardins and Trists personal experiences, for instance, should look elsewhere. Thus Greenberg provides thorough accounts of the Buena Vista and Mexico City campaigns, but only passing attention to the U.S. conquest of New Mexico and California and nothing at all about the spring 1847 march of a segment of Scotts army to Alvarado. The secret peace mission of <i>New York Sun</i> editor Moses Beach and the journalist/adventurer Jane McManus Storm, based on formal State Department instructions, is absent, though one of the books strengths is its attention to wartime journalism. Because none of her five protagonists hail from the Deep South, Greenberg never convincingly explores how the war played out in that part of the country. Still, <i>Wicked War</i> is an excellent selection for anyone wanting a thoughtful, compelling, and challenging account of the war that gained the nation much of its western empire and helped set the stage for the Civil War. Instructors of college offerings in U.S. military history, antebellum sectionalism, and American expansionism would be well advised to consider requiring this book once it appears in its inevitable paper edition.

5337|978-0-8203-3326-7|$29.95 |Flush Times & Fever Dreams: A Story of Capitalism and Slavery in the Age of Jackson|\N|Rothman, Joshua D.|\N|\N|<h3>Assessing Slavery and Society</h3><br><p>From the appearance of the word capitalism in the subtitle, readers might infer that Joshua Rothmans <i>Flush Times & Fever Dreams</i> concentrates on financial or economic aspects of slavery during the boom years of 1830s Mississippi.  This expectation would be mistaken.  Rothman, who is an associate professor of history at the University of Alabama and director of the Frances S. Summersell Center for the Study of the South, instead tells a series of gripping and often grisly tales of that era.   The account begins with fortune-seeker Virgil Stewarts 1833 arrival in Madison County, Mississippi, on the eve of the opening of sales of former Choctaw lands by the federal government; proceeds through Stewarts entanglement with notorious criminal John Murrell; and ends with two bouts of mass hysteria and extra-legal executions: the slave insurrection scare of 1835, in which six white men and at least a dozen slaves were killed; and a somewhat lesser episode in Vicksburg the same  year, when five men alleged to be professional gamblers were seized and hanged.</p><p>Rothman tells these stories well, evoking a sense of social and psychological context for the main historical actors, so that the actions described become understandable, to the extent that delusional mob behavior can ever be understood.  Almost every paragraph is meticulously documented, using both archival and secondary sources, but many readers will prefer to skip the notes and concentrate on the unfolding narrative.   The book devotes little effort and makes little contribution to determining the degree of truth in the sensational allegations that were taken seriously at the time. But Rothman is surely right to suggest that beliefs in murderous plots and vast slave-stealing conspiracies were more reflections of widely-shared apprehensions and ambivalences than responses to objectively plausible threats.</p><p>         The term capitalism, however, seems to mean little beyond a broad expression for a wide-open frontier setting in which rapid settlement was driven by the promise of instant riches. Previous scholars with more social-scientific orientation (specifically, Laurence Shore and Christopher Morris) have emphasized the contrast between responses in different counties, highlighting the relative absence of towns, institutions and established networks in Madison as compared to Hinds County.  Rothman dismisses this analysis in a footnote, asserting without further discussion that the counties were far more alike than they were different and the variance between how whites reacted to the scare in the two places is easily overstated (361 n. 10).  Although the conclusion may be valid  in the absence of quantitative indicators, the degree of difference is after all a subjective judgment  but the dismissal evades the underlying argument, which is that underdevelopment of community institutions and networks throughout the cotton frontier region, especially relative to the influx of slave population, contributes to an understanding of the social bases for the insurrection panic.</p><p>  Another sub-theme in the book is the insecure and often precarious status of nonslaveholding whites in areas dominated by large plantations.  Both Stewart and Murrell were economic losers, trying to advance themselves through unconventional channels.   Rothman notes that the whites who became targets during the scare stood relatively low on the economic ladder, though the chances of attack were greater for those who seemed deviant in some other way as well, such as the practice of steam doctoring (143).  The author emphasizes that ambivalence about risk-taking, gambling, and easy money during flush times were national phenomena, not unique to the slave South.  As formulated, this statement is undoubtedly true.  By emphasizing the generality of such socio-psychological sentiments, however, Rothman misses the opportunity to compare northern and southern frontier cultures more systematically.  Geographic patterns of settlement were quite different in the two cases, and the root of the contrast is plausibly related to the institution of slavery. In the absence of property rights in humans, free-state settlement was driven by efforts to recruit scarce labor from the East, providing a modicum of status and protection even to those without property. Ambivalences and apprehensions were everywhere, but only in the South were whites hanged for alleged conspiracies to foment slave insurrections.</p><p>In his Epilogue, Rothman argues that the events in Mississippi in 1835 contributed to the coming of the Civil War, by aggravating the regions caricatures of each other.  Northern abolitionists pointed to the hangings as confirmation of the depravity of slavery.   Defenders of slavery were not slow to link Murrell and his gangs to diabolical abolitionist schemes.   He might have added that the events of the 1830s fostered regional polarization by solidifying southern unity along racial lines.  After 1835, nonslaveholding white southerners could hardly fail to appreciate the risks of an insufficient display of support for the institution of slavery.</p><p><i>Gavin Wright is the William Robertson Coe Professor of American Economic History at Stanford University.

5338|978-0-674-06690-8|$29.95 |Lincolns Hundred Days: The Emancipation Proclamation and the War for the Union|\N|Masur, Louis P.|\N|\N|"<h3>Examining Lincolns Most Critical Days</h3><br><p>How do you dramatize a decree? How do you turn emancipation into art? Louis P. Masur asks in <i>Lincolns Hundred Days</i> (264). These questions make his work an apt counterpart to a film released a few months after Masurs book, Stephen Spielbergs <i>Lincoln</i> (2012). A tight chronological focus is a central strategy in both instances. Masur, reporting that an interval of one hundred days has been the benchmark for presidential success since Franklin D. Roosevelts first term, highlights the period between the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation of September 22, 1862, and the final decree of January 1, 1863 (8). Spielberg picks up on New Years Day in 1865 and recounts the month culminating in approval of the Thirteenth Amendment by the House of Representatives. Both narratives jump ahead at the end to Lincolns almost mystical visit to Virginia at the close of the war. These parallels illuminate some differences between literature and film and also two competing interpretations of Lincoln and American politics.</p>	<p>The author of books centered on a single year, a single World Series, and a single photograph, Masur recognizes the limitations as well as the potential of the compression sustained by Spielberg. Where the movie devotes only a few minutes to its prelude and epilogue, the time frame announced in Masurs title is more emblematic than literal. The introductory account of the September 22 cabinet meeting on the Proclamation points out that emancipation was a process, not a moment (8). Almost a third of the book covers the period from the outbreak of the war until September 22, and a similar fraction covers the period from the signing of the Proclamation until the end of the war. But the central section encapsulates the fundamental change across time at the heart of Masurs story: over the hundred days, Lincoln became bolder (281). The final Proclamation welcomed African Americans into military service, a crucial aspect of national citizenship.  Lincoln backed away considerably from his longstanding support for colonization, although he was not yet as ready to imagine a biracial United States as he would become by April 1865. Compared to the legislative challenge that the president confronts in <i>Lincoln</i>, the coalescence of moral principle in <i>Lincolns One Hundred Days</i> is a gradual development. Masur uses as an epigraph Ralph Waldo Emersons observation in November 1862 that liberty is a slow fruit.</p> <p>This maturation is time-consuming, partly because it involves so many people. Spielberg locates the triumph of freedom in the halls of Congress and the White House and in the back rooms where lawmakers negotiate; Masur celebrates a democratic forum much wider than any movie could accommodate. His version of Lincoln is not a combination of Olympian sage and deal-making pragmatist but a thoughtful, cautious man of goodwill who both led and responded to a transformation in public sentiment (279). Masur contrasts his broad canvas with Francis Bicknell Carpenters painting of <i>The First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation</i> (1864), an oppressively stiff portrait of the president and cabinet. The extent to which <i>Lincolns One Hundred Days</i> re-opens the blogosphere of the Civil War era is measured by comparison with Allen C. Guelzos <i>Lincolns Emancipation Proclamation: The End of Slavery in America</i> (2004), a scholarly work of similar scope and ambition. Masurs text is less than fifteen percent longer but his index is more than seventy-five percent longer, mostly because he discusses so many more people. Masur cites at least three times as many newspapers and magazines. He is concerned, moreover, not only with widely influential voices, but also with the private views expressed in soldiers correspondence and other registers of popular opinion. The scene-stealing supporting role in <i>Lincoln</i> is Thaddeus Stevens, the blistering abolitionist who concludes at a key moment that temporary disavowal of his racial egalitarianism will best achieve his goals. The comparably colorful radical in the film version of <i>Lincolns Hundred Days</i> would be diarist Adam Gurowski, whose passionate engagement in the crisis is the public spirit behind the Proclamation, even if he is disappointed by the presidents slow and partial progress.</p><p>The emphasis on Lincolns growth is the fundamental difference between the portraits offered by Spielberg and Masur. The president in <i>Lincoln</i> occupies the high ground before the story begins, and the movie describes his resourceful efforts to bring other people, and the law, up to his moral level. The president in <i>Lincolns Hundred Days</i> only eventually came to understand that preserving the nation required emancipation, and that the abolition of slavery was an act of justice in its own right (279). This approach aligns Masur with the most insightful work on Lincoln, much of which he cites in his impressively up-to-date annotations. To be sure, scholarly differences within this viewpoint remain significant. Masur is considerably less critical of Lincolns hesitancy in abandoning colonization than the outstanding recent research by Eric Foner and Mark Neely. His president is less accountable for the sufferings of African Americans and more autonomously deliberate in his decisions.</p><p>Designed to reach a general readership, Masurs vision of democratic leadership is more inspiring than cinematic pining for a lost father figure. Spielberg follows Lincoln from legislative victory to a battlefield underworld in Virginia that foreshadows his own imminent death, which the film artfully presents from the viewpoint of his young son. Masurs parallel rendition follows Lincoln to Richmond, where the president sits in Jefferson Daviss chair and shares in a day of jubilee with freedpeople. Lincoln does not die in this book. As the president leaves Virginia, he tells his allies that I came down among you without any definite plans, and when I go home I shant regret a moment I have spent with you (286). He is the model of a free man, alive to possibilities for educational self-experience. His self-emancipation is essential to his political legacy.</p><p></i>Thomas J.

5339|978-0-19-975872-2|$29.95 |Sick From Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction|\N|Downs, Jim|\N|\N|<h3>Digging Deeper into Emancipation</h3><p>Jim Downs <i>Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction</i> offers new insight into experiences of the recently emancipated during Reconstruction.  Rather than treat emancipation as a watershed moment that created a clear divide between slavery and freedom, Downs casts emancipation as a process that only just began with Lincolns Proclamation. Part of this process, Downs shows, was for the federal government to address issues of freedpeoples health.  He shows that the prejudice and misconception of many officials hampered the federal governments response to major health crises within newly freed populations.  Moreover, the governments reactions were slowed by general bureaucratic inefficiency and ineffectiveness.  Downs persuasively argues that access to care became an integral right of citizenship for many freedpeople during Reconstruction, and he shows that this access only came to freewomen and freemen through the work of activists, freedpeople, and caring physicians in the 1870s.</p><p>Downs begins his book with a harrowing story of an unnamed boy who, after emancipation, traveled with his mother, father, and five siblings to a Union camp in Chattanooga in 1863.   There, his father enlisted, and Union officials sent the family to a camp in Nashville. In Nashville, the boys mother died, and officials decided to send the children back to Chattanooga.  The remaining family members suffered through starvation and a smallpox epidemic, which wracked the freed population in the camp.  In the winter of 1865, the young boy became afflicted with frostbite, and Union soldiers had to amputate his feet.  For Downs, this story is emblematic of the problems former slaves faced following emancipation.  Union officials  military men focused on winning a war  were unprepared for the care of this population.  Emancipation thus did not bring immediate freedom, but instead sickness, death, and suffering.</p><p>Things did not get much better for the newly freed after the war ended.   The ego of federal officials and military leaders clashed as they debated who should manage the transformation of the newly freed into a productive free labor force.  Meanwhile, government intervention ground to a halt. Disease, starvation, and mobility remained hallmarks of life for the recently emancipated. Ultimately, activists in benevolent organizations who tried to care for the newly freed grew so shocked by what they saw and frustrated with the futility of their efforts that they petitioned the federal government to take more direct action.  Thomas Eliot, a representative from Massachusetts, brought forth a bill to do that, noting that the liberation of millions of slaves without federal protection would have constituted a crime against humanity (61).</p><p>The Freedmens Bill passed the House by a scant two-vote majority in 1864, and Lincoln signed it into law in March 1865.  Among the things it created were Freedmens Hospitals to care for the emancipated.  But here, too, the story of suffering and illness continued.  Downs notes that as a result of the slowness of the federal bureaucracy health conditions worsened, and, in many situations, freedpeople died while waiting for treatment.  Later, in 1866, Andrew Johnson vetoed a bill meant to keep funds flowing to these hospitals.  His veto made a dire situation only worse.  Others, like O.O. Howard, the head of the Freedmens Bureau, proved meddlesome even when trying to do good.  Downs shows that the well-intentioned D.C. bureaucrat created unnecessary headaches for doctors when he ordered all Freedmens Hospitals plant their own vegetable gardens on site.  The orders proved problematic for hospitals already overworked and short on staff.</p><p>The situation only began to change when doctors, benevolent organizations, and freedpeople forced state and local medical institutions to accept those considered disabled. By doing so, Downs concludes, federal officials made a critical claim about the meaning of citizenship: access to medical services became a benefit of citizenship (165).  Later, the federal pension system for veterans empowered many of the emancipated to describe their suffering and illness  and to receive some compensation.  Finally, Howard University began a medical program that churned out African American doctors who returned to their communities to provide greater medical care. Still, Downs proposal that emancipation was a process only begun with the Proclamation remains true; access may have improved by the 1870s, but equality remained distant.</p>  <p>At only 178 pages of text, Downs crisp narrative adds significant knowledge to the era of Reconstruction.  Downs core contribution is to show how health, citizenship, and emancipation became entwined.  One could not enjoy freedom without ones health.  Receiving access to care was an arduous struggle for many of the freed slaves. But also notable is Downs recovery of a smallpox epidemic that broke out amongst the freed population in Washington D.C. and the South.  The epidemic has largely been overlooked, but Downs argument that a massive smallpox epidemic afflicted the emancipated is compelling and worthy of more study.  He also shows how ideas about race and illness influenced the governments poor reaction to the epidemic.</p><p>Throughout <i>Sick from Freedom</i>, Downs does an admirable job of giving voice to the emancipated, a group whose voices are often absent from the historic record or, when they do appear, obfuscated by the prejudice of the record-taker.  Nonetheless, his work is primarily an institutional history that studies the reaction of the federal government and the institutions formed to support it to the needs and demands of newly free men and women.  I anticipate this book, along with Gretchen Longs new <i>Doctoring Freedom: The Politics of African American Medical Care in Slavery and Freedom</i>, will make for regular readings in graduate seminars.</p>  <p><i>Patrick Spero is assistant professor of history and leadership studies at Williams College.

5340|978-0-8071-4508-1|$48.95 |Transition to an Industrial South: Athens, Georgia, 1830-1870|\N|Gagnon, Michael J.|\N|\N|"<h3>Re-examining Southern Industrial Growth</h3><p>Not long ago, when Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman published <i>Time on the Cross</i> (1974), economic historians studying the antebellum South fiercely debated the profitability of slavery. Now scholars focus on a different question: how modern was the Old South? Recent books by Brian Schoen and John Majewski, and a collection edited by Schoen, Diane Barnes, and Frank Towers are among the more important contributions to that dialogue.  In <i>Transition to an Industrial South: Athens, Georgia, 1830-1870</i>, Michael J. Gagnon tackles this issue by examining a town on the forefront of Southern industrial development. Although Gagnon presents much valuable information about the early decades of textile production in Athens, Georgia, his broader argument about southern attitudes toward industry and the pace of change remains questionable.<p><p>Beginning in the late 1820s, as Gagnon illustrates, Athens led the state of Georgia in developing a new industry: cotton textiles. Between 1829 and 1833 entrepreneurs opened three mills to produce cotton cloth in a town hitherto known largely as the home of the University of Georgia. Almost immediately, the factories were successful, returning high profits to their founders. When contrasted to northern mills, these enterprises enjoyed several natural advantages: water power flowed year round and cotton grew nearby. The new factories also benefited from the latest technology, with machinery for spinning and weaving brought in from the North. During these early years, Athenians outpaced all other cloth producers in the state, claiming in 1840 fully 38 percent of the capitalization of all Georgia textile mills and 42 percent of the total output of cloth.</p><p>Gagnon explores several aspects of this early southern industrialization. While the composition of the workforce fluctuated over time, most operatives were white, female, and young. Initially, factories made extensive use of slaves, although African Americans never comprised a majority of the workforce. Their numbers soon diminished, and after 1850 when cotton and slave prices soared few black workers remained. The handful still employed undertook work that whites disdained, such as toting and breaking up the bales of cotton. An 1860 enumeration showed that women comprised about 63 percent of the workers, while the average age of all operatives was nineteen. Although most employees had local roots, superintendents and the cadre of skilled workers who taught others the techniques of carding, dying, spinning, and weaving most often came from the North.</p><p>The book also profiles the entrepreneurs who began Athenss mills, making clear they were older, wealthy men (generally in their 40s), involved in a variety of activities. Most held at least 20 slaves and so were considered planters. But they were far more venturesome than the many who simply focused on raising cotton. They invested in town lots, tracts in other states, and local banks. Although not a mill owner until the 1850s, William S. Grady, the father of New South promoter Henry Grady, illustrates these wide-ranging interests. Along with investing in textile production, he operated a dry goods business and oversaw the local gas utility.</p><p><i>Transition to an Industrial South</i> also makes clear that the reform impulse both among the businessmen and the common folk in Athens was muted  certainly when compared to the campaigns shaking the North. The temperance movement in Athens was short-lived. Business leaders did support education, both in common schools and Sunday schools, and several served as trustees for the University of Georgia.  A county agricultural society was established, but soon failed. Some workers came together in a Mechanics Mutual Association, with a focus on burial insurance and widows pensions. But there were no strikes and little worker militancy in Athens.<p><p>As Gagnon shows with a detailed examination of plans and counter-proposals, Athens lost out when a coterie of investors built a railroad linking north Georgia to more distant markets. Athenians lobbied hard to be on the mainline of this road. But the plans proposed by a group of Augusta financiers won out when Georgia chartered the Western and Atlantic Railroad in December 1836. The junction chosen on the edge of the Cherokee Nation would grow into the flourishing city of Atlanta, while Athens was served only by a feeder line. Thanks in part to improved transportation, Augusta, Macon, Columbus, and Atlanta flourished, while Athens lagged behind. In 1850 the three Athens factories accounted for only 17 percent of the states capitalization in textiles, and 11 percent of the production of cloth  well below the levels recorded in 1840.</p><p>Athens, however, rebounded during the war and Reconstruction. Wartime demand for clothing kept the factories busy, while a new armory provided Confederate forces with weapons. Athenss location away from the main rail junctions now proved an advantage. Shermans army burned Atlanta, but left the university town untouched. In a turbulent economy, local entrepreneurs wisely hedged their bets. They accepted Confederate money, but converted some of their profits into foreign currencies. Shareholders were paid in kind, while extensive charitable donations helped undercut charges of wartime profiteering. Favorable conditions continued during the second half of the 1860s, with firms now acquiring large reserves of cotton to protect against crop fluctuations.</p><p>But Gagnon provides more than a chronicle of Athenss growth. He also wants to demonstrate the strong forces that helped modernize the Southand here his arguments are more questionable. A case study of industrialization in the heart of the antebellum cotton belt . . ., he remarks, will demonstrate the importance of ideology in mobilizing for industrialization. It will show that slave-owning southerners fostered a free-labor industrial workforce that was not seen as a threat to the Souths domestic institutions (5). Gagnon sharply criticizes Eugene Genovese, noting: In his classic Political Economy of Slavery, Genovese declared that antebellum southerners considered promoters of southern industrialization to be damned fools . . .  (201).</p><p>Gagnon, however, misreads Genovese, and in fact his evidence supports the balanced formulation set forth in <i>Political Economy of Slavery</i>.  Genovese contends that many Southerners gave up their opposition to industrial expansion but generally retained their hostility to manufactures as a system. (Genovese, 181). That cautious approach to new enterprises appears to characterize industrialization in Athens. As Gagnon observes, the founding of the factories in took place during a period of intense anti-tariff agitationleading to Nullification in South Carolina. He illustrates that even those newspapers foreseeing benefits from local factories, pointed out the dangers of widespread industrialization. The solution, as posed by one editorialist Gagnon quotes, was Let us commence on a small scale, with caution, and [invest] such funds as we can spare . . . in small establishments. Gagnon comments: As a model, this counsel succeeded because it addressed both ideological concerns about the effect of industrial organization upon southern society, and practical problems regarding the insufficiency of southern investment capital (26). Similarly, as Gagnons evidence also makes clear (and as he notes in passing), most southerners continued investing in the known perils of commercial agriculture (31). Relatively few put their money into industry despite the high profits made by these mills. Owning field slaves conveyed status and prestige in a way that industrial enterprises did not.</p><p>In sum, Michael Gagnon provides a valuable case study of Athens, Georgia, and early Southern industrialization  even if the conclusions suggested by his data are not always the ones that he might draw.</p>	<p><i>Marc Egnal is a professor of history at York University, Toronto, and author of</i> Clash of Extremes: The Economic Origins of the Civil War <i>(2009).</i></p>"|Egnal, Marc|Winter 2013|2/1/2013|Review|\N|\N|Louisiana State University Press|\N|Science;Social_History;Socioeconomics;Technology|\N|\N|"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=242 alt=\Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/TransitionToAnIndustrialSouth.jpg\"">"""|\N
5341|978-0-8071-4512-8|$42.50 |Slaves for Hire: Renting Enslaved Laborers in Antebellum Virginia|\N|Zaborney, John J.|\N|\N|<h3>A Fresh Perspective on Slavery</h3><p>There has long been debate among historians of American slavery about the significance of the practice of hiring out slaves. Scholars from Clement Eaton in 1960 to Midori Tagaki in the late 1990s drew attention to the greater autonomy enjoyed by many hired-out slaves, particularly in urban settings, compared with those under the direct control of their owners. Others, from Richard Wade in the 1960s to Jonathan D. Martin four decades later, suggested that hiring out either illustrated the incompatibility of slavery with economic development or threatened to destabilize the slave system by dividing authority over slaves. In <i>Slaves for Hire</i>, John J. Zaborney provides a rounded, well-documented study of slave hiring in Virginia that  while building on and incorporating earlier findings  argues that the practice bolstered rather than compromised slavery, and also helped build cross-class solidarity among whites in the slave South.</p><p>For long-recognized reasons, post-Revolutionary and antebellum Virginia produced a surplus of slaves. While sale and forced migration to the Lower South and the Southwestern frontier removed many slaves to other regions, Zaborney points out that hiring out of slaves within Virginia was also a factor in bringing demand for slave labor in line with the supply. Virginias slave population grew during the antebellum period, but prices for slaves and rates for hiring them also rose. Hired slaves represented a significant proportion of the total in many parts of the state; of adult slaves in Loudon County, for example, 34 percent were hired out in 1860. Slave hiring was pervasive. It was common in rural as well as urban areas; in agriculture as well as in manufacturing; in domestic work as well as craft production; and Zaborney stresses its significance to mining and railroad construction, which brought slave labor into far-flung corners of the Commonwealth. Not least of his contributions is to give close attention to the gendered aspects of the slave hiring system: women slaves and their experiences are as much a focus of this account as those of the male fieldhands, craftsmen, and laborers who have usually been discussed in studies of slave hiring.</p><p>Drawing on census reports, slave schedules, hiring bonds, letters, diaries, court records, and other sources Zaborney describes the array of circumstances in which slave hiring took place, from owners desire to earn income from renting slaves or to place extra hands, to employers demands for labor, and middle-class households desire for domestic workers. He considers life-cycle issues, such as the placing-out of child slaves in other families, and the hiring-out of slaves by widows. He devotes part of a chapter to the debates among some Presbyterians during the 1840s as to whether their church should continue to hire out the slaves it owned or sell them. While he pays full attention to the patterns of urban hiring that historians have long noted, Zaborney also stresses the role of slave hiring in the local exchanges conducted among rural households, and in the patronage relationships between large slaveholders and their small-farmer neighbors in the countryside. While he considers the many functions of hiring for slaveowners and their clients, he also pays full attention to its effects on the experiences of slaves. Not surprisingly, the story was mixed. Some slaves achieved measures of the autonomy that earlier studies have noted, not least those men who, often in urban contexts, got to find their own lodgings and might obtain money for themselves by earning overwork payments in the task system. The frequency of slave-hiring also, Zaborney suggests, retained in Virginia considerable numbers of slaves who would otherwise have been sold or transported to other parts of the South. But these advantages were heavily qualified. Hired-out slaves were often separated from their families. Working conditions were often harsh or outright dangerous. Though hired slaves might gain some negotiating-space from the split authority and inherent tensions between their owners and the masters who rented them, Zaborney presents many instances in which the reverse was true, in which owners and renters agreed on harsh punishments and other measures to enforce discipline. If hiring out divided mastery over slaves, he argues, it was within parameters that sustained, rather than undermined, the slave system.</p><p>This was due to the very pervasiveness of slave-hiring that he documents. Developed over decades from the American Revolution on, the hiring system became institutionalized in Virginia society and culture. Terms and conditions in hiring contracts became regularized, and  because they were commonly understood  often implicit, rather than explicitly specified. There were annual hiring fairs. Agents and other institutions emerged to facilitate the slave-hiring system, to match owners with renters, and to supervise the movement of slaves between them. Above all, Zaborney argues, the very variety of contexts in which hiring occurred ensured that many segments of white society became directly involved in the slave system even as the distribution of wealth and slave ownership became more unequal. Slave hiring meant that a wide array of white men and women who did not own slaves nevertheless obtained the use of slave labor and the right to exercise authority and discipline over slaves. Renters of slaves, Zaborney implies, were hiring not just labor-power but the fruits of racial domination. Perhaps as much as the political rights obtained by white men, this social and economic power enjoyed by women and men alike represented the wages of whiteness in the antebellum South. If so, it helps explain how southern leaders obtained the support of non-slaveowning whites for their secession adventure in 1860 and 1861.</p><p><i>Slaves For Hire</i> is a rich study, steeped in many individual stories that give valuable insights into the hiring system. Its impact, however, comes more from the accumulation of examples than from systematic measurement. Future studies might address a number of themes that could test and perhaps strengthen the arguments it advances. Sharper attention to chronology could be helpful; though most emphasis here is on the 1840s and 1850s theres a disconcerting tendency to jump back to the late-eighteenth or early nineteenth century for examples, and that could obscure some issues. What might be said, for example, about the relationship between slave hiring and the overall prices of slaves over time? To what extent was hiring a consequence of slaveowners desire to hold slaves as investments during price rises? And was the concatenation of slave hiring and white solidarity that Zaborney postulates a persistent facet of Virginia society between the Revolution and the Civil War, or did it emerge most strongly in the buoyant markets of the 1840s and 1850s in parallel with sectional disputes over the expansion of slavery, the assertion of positive good justifications for it, and the emerging influence of scientific racism? Finally, it would have been useful to have a fuller comparative discussion of slaveholding Virginia with other regions. Zaborney does note that slave-hiring markets in Delaware and Maryland were weaker, though his explanation that this was due to smaller internal improvement projects seems not entirely convincing. If white solidarity cemented by a pervasive hiring system was as important as he suggests, was that so primarily in Virginia, or did it also apply more widely in the plantation South? And what about those parts of Virginia, Tennessee and elsewhere where apparently it did not apply? Was attachment to the Union from 1861 on as much correlated with the weakness of slave hiring as it was with slave ownership in general?</p><p><i>Christopher Clark is at the University of Connecticut and is author of</i> Social Change in America: From Revolution through the Civil War<i> (2006) and The Agrarian Context of American Capitalist Development, in Michael Zakim and Gary J.

5342|978-0-7864-6860-7|$45.00 |Hood's Texas Brigade in the Civil War|\N|Williams, Edward B.|\N|\N|"<h3>New Study on one of the Confederacys Most Prominent Regiments</h3><p>Hood's Texas Brigade remains arguably the best-known Confederate unit from the Lone Star State, but it has been more than forty years since a new comprehensive history of these men appeared in print.  The first such effort, of course, was Joseph B. Polley's very personal account, which was published in 1910, followed almost sixty years later by Harold B. Simpson's popular history, subtitled \Lee's Grenadier Guard.\""  The latter proved to be only one of four volumes on Hood's Texas Brigade by Simpson, who also edited several memoirs concerning the Texans. Edward B. Williams, an independent scholar, promises to stand on the broad shoulders of these two story-telling giants and provide an updated account grounded in the new research that has been unearthed in the past decades.  While he is a smooth writer himself, and his book will take its place on the working bookshelves of many scholars and buffs alike, he does not deliver a study with the analytical edge most academics demand today.</p>  <p>Those who are familiar with the history of Hood's Texas Brigade will find many well-known stories in this volume, while those who have not studied its campaigns will encounter much to entertain and educate them.   There are single chapters devoted to each of the primary engagements: Gaines Mill, Second Bull Run, Antietam, Suffolk, Chickamauga, Knoxville, and Appomattox.  The fighting in the Wilderness provides material for two chapters, as does the final siege at Richmond and Petersburg.  Not all of the favorite tales are herethe story of George A. Branard being blasted at Gettysburg is absentbut there are enough to satisfy most of those who are interested in a lively narrative.  Williams is quite politic in his story-tellingfor example, in the Wilderness it was \""several Texans\"" who grabbed Traveller's bridle and urged Gen. Robert E. Lee to abstain from leading them into combat (221).  The author prudently refrains from choosing one name from among the multitude who claimed that honor then and after the Civil War.  There are a few missteps, however, in recounting some incidents, such as having John Marshall lead the way into an icy creek in March 1862 on page 29 and having John Bell Hood himself do the honors on page 52.  It is also highly doubtful that Hood's Texans originated the Rebel Yell, as Williams has a Wisconsin major claim on page 108.  But in the balance, these minor points do not outweigh the value of this work as a fine narrative.</p> <p>Where academics, and even some laymen, will find fault is in the lack of analysis.  While there is a chapter devoted to the \""Anatomy\"" of the brigade, only officers receive much attention (25). There is little discussion of the men in the ranks, whence they came, or what happened to them outside of the war.  The author makes no use of compiled service records, pension records, tax rolls, census materials, or even the most recent editions of memoirs to tell the reader more about Hood's Texans.  Other scholars have made some attempt to analyze social origins within the brigade, modeling their work after similar studies of other units, but there are no citations to them here. There is a hefty bibliography, but at crucial moments such as when Williams provides appendices on battle casualties, Simpson becomes the principal source of information (along with the published estimates of Frederick Phisterer).  There is no discussion of recruiting during the war, and conscription is dismissed with a reference to Simpson declaring there was only one draftee in the whole brigade.  A quick survey of the compiled service records for Company F of the 4th Texas Infantry would reveal the names of four men who were drafted and another who was paid to be a substitute for a fifth conscript, and there were certainly more like them.</p> <p>This is a labor of love by a skilled writer, not an academic.  While some will rightly celebrate that fact, as academics are often sadly lacking in story-telling skills, there is still much of the tale of Hood's Texas Brigade to be told.  Williams has provided an entertaining narrative, not an incisive analysis of the Texans and their colleagues from South Carolina, Georgia, and Arkansas.  As such, it serves as a complement to Polley and Simpson.  It will be much cited in other works, and it will be often used to compile lectures for classrooms and public forums.  But those who want more analysis will have to wait. </p><p><i>Richard B.

5343|978-0-8139-3317-7|$45.00 |Reconstructing the Campus: Higher Education and the American Civil War|\N|Cohen, Michael David|\N|\N|"<h3>Understanding the Intersection of Wartime and Education</h3><br><p>Historians of the Civil War agree that the conflict served as a watershed period for the nation evident in almost all areas of American life and culture.  In particular, the demands of war accelerated the movement toward modernity in the nations major political and economic institutions.   Michael David Cohens study of higher education introduces readers to another, often overlooked, institution effected by the war and its aftermath.  Drawing from government records and documents from seven major colleges scattered throughout the four geographic regions, Cohen concludes that the Civil War drove some of the most important educational reforms of the late nineteenth century (14).  In particular, he posits that the conflict and its aftermath created a relationship between the government and higher education, introduced new curricula, and reshaped the nature of student populations, ultimately producing the modern American university and college systems with which we identify today.</p><p>Following a chronological and topical order, Cohen reveals the depths to which the war permeated campuses, bringing about a new culture of higher education.  His examination of pre-war campus life underscores this depth of change.  On the eve of the Civil War, faculties offered limited curricula intended to prepare students for a narrow range of professions.  The student body, too, drew from a small pool of American youths.  Sons of elite planters from the South attended schools while those from the North came from more economically diverse backgrounds.  Men and women attended separate schools where admissions requirements placed high moral standards on their students.  Little relationship between the government and colleges existed as most schools remained private, denominational institutions.  Yet, as Cohen demonstrates, the war transformed this insulated and elitist culture.</p><p>The Civil War forced colleges to adapt to changing conditions and reevaluate their role in American life.  As secession loomed, class dialogues shifted their focus away from traditional topics to discussions such as Lincoln and an impending war.  Faculty members likewise rose up as experts on the conflict, advocating either a pro- or anti-Confederate position.  When the war broke out, male students left school for the military front either as draftees or volunteers.  The depleted student population caused some institutions to close while others struggled to remain open.  Cohen identifies that the greatest changes to schools occurred in the South because of its regional proximity to military engagements.  Colleges, for example, turned into makeshift hospitals and Union troops pillaged some campuses.  Wartime inflation likewise created economic hardships that threatened to close the doors of southern schools.  Those institutions that survived the war-- whether northern or southern, eastern or western--witnessed the advent of new curricula, student populations, and government involvement.</p>  <p>Faculties and trustees initiated drastic reforms to curricula that would transform the nature of higher education.  Cohen contends that the greatest change came in redesigned curricula that would better serve a postbellum nation in which more students sought training in a wider range of vocations (53).  Military education backed, in many cases, by government funding emerged from a need to produce citizen-soldiers prepared for war.  The Morrill Land-Grant College Act of 1862 likewise helped establish universities that concentrated on agricultural and engineering learning.  Southern colleges adopted these reforms in an attempt to attract more students after the war.  Regardless of regional interests, leaders in higher education realized the need to alter curriculum in order to serve the needs of a changing student population and to meet the demands of a nation on an accelerated path to modernity.</p>	<p>A particularly revealing aspect of Cohens study is the emergence of a new, diversified student population.  The aftermath of war and the onset of Reconstruction created an atmosphere that encouraged potential students from varied backgrounds to turn to education as a way to rebuild their lives.  Schools became coeducational and biracial, and welcomed non-traditional students from broader socioeconomic groups.  The creation of land-grant colleges along with financial government assistance in the form of veterans benefits drew non-traditional, older students to higher education.  Before the war, men and women tended to travel to receive their education, oftentimes going out of state.  Yet the economic hardships of travel along with lower tuition costs for in-state students at land-grant institutions encouraged men and women to remain in their respective states.  Cohen concludes that the results of this desire to stay close to home meant that schools became less geographically diverse (128).</p><p>The strongest argument Cohen posits is that the relationships colleges and universities forged beyond the campus walls.  During the 1860s and 1870s, the federal government grew increasingly involved in higher education.  From the Morrill Land-Grant College Act and veterans educational benefits to curricula development and establishing a supportive bureaucracy, the federal government situated itself within the campus culture and facilitated the transition to a modern university system.  A new role for the government, for example, was in the collecting and analyzing of statistical information on higher education.  To accommodate this effort, the government established the Department of Education in 1867.  Promoting higher education also garnered the interest of government officials, as seen in the strong presence of colleges and universities at the 1876 Centennial Exposition.  Institutions also reached out to their surrounding communities for the first time.  Public lectures and extension schools provided a new role for higher education in the community, establishing a tradition of public service still evident today.</p> <p>Cohens lively and engaging study of higher education brings into high relief the transformative nature of the Civil War and its aftermath.  He aptly demonstrates how the conflict reconstructed campuses in a way that accommodated a changing culture and people who sought new opportunities for learning.  Although it seems, at times, as if little more can be said about the Civil War due to the breadth of studies on the subject, Cohen reveals that more can be done to understand how the conflict gave way to a new, modern nation.</p>  <p><i>Victoria E.

It is an intellectual history of how doctors thought about illness, race, and gender. Doctors in the era were struggling to identify themselves as men of science, modernity, and standing, but the limits of medical knowledge left room for considerable speculation about how health, race, and sex intersect. White male doctors took advantage of the void to promote theories and practices intended to validate southern slave society and their place within it. Theirs was a tricky endeavor. Time and again physicians had to confront contradictions inherent in judging men superior to women and whites superior to blacks. They walked a fine line lest they imply the superiority of black men to white women or fail to account for incongruities. (Where did people of ambiguous race or gender fit into the scheme?)</p><p>The task of categorizing bodies was made difficult by their biological sameness and the expectation that race and gender mattered. Women, thought to be defined by their reproductive organs, had to be sorted out in such a way as to ensure that the perceived weakness of white female bodies did not render them somehow inferior to the bodies of their black sisters whose supposed strength suited them for hard labor. In this case, doctors attributed the physical weaknesses of white women to the effects of civilization, which had the advantage (for the ruling class) of turning inferior physicality into cultural superiority.</p><p>Somehow, doctors managed to uphold (to their own satisfaction if not that of others) the correctness of the southern social order. Marli F. Weiner shows how they did this by carefully analyzing their writing in published medical journals. Scholars familiar with the history of medicine will more than likely already be familiar with much of this argument, made previously by Seven M. Stowe, Todd L. Savitt, and other historians. Yet there is more to this book than this one thread of analysis.</p><p>Weiner moves beyond physician-created sources at times to explore the ways in which lay men and women, black and white, thought of medicine, gender, and slavery. Although other historians have explored the topic of southern health and healing, most have not addressed all of the players (white and black, slave and free) in one book.  The inclusion of this cast of characters makes Weiners book an imaginative and valuable addition to the literature on medicine, gender, and slavery. The focus is on what lay people thought about illness rather than on how they experienced illness or medical practice.</p> <p><i>Sex, Sickness, and Slavery</i> has been published posthumously with the help of Mazie Hough. It represents a culmination of Weiners lifelong research into an antebellum world shaped by the power of white men. It will appeal to historians of the South, medicine and science, race, gender and women. The book offers a well-written explanation of how partisan ideas of race and gender can intrude into scientific thinking.</p>   <p><i>Marie Jenkins Schwartz, professor of history at the University of Rhode Island, Kingston, writes about the history of slavery and its legacy.

5345|ISBN 978-0-8131-3610-3|$35.00 |Remembering the Battle of the Crater:  War as Murder|\N|Levin, Kevin M.|\N|\N|<h3>Fighting the Battle of Memory</h3><br><p><i>Remembering the Battle of the Crater:  War as Murder</i> by Kevin Levin offers a valuable addition to the growing body of scholarship on the American Civil War and popular memory.  Levin shows how, for much of the post-war period, the story of the battle of the Crater was explained in terms of the courage of the white combatants and their honor in fighting for what they believed in.  Minimizing and ignoring the role of black troops at the Crater made it possible to evade divisive issues arising from slavery and racism. While acknowledging a debt to David Blights <i>Race and Reunion</i>, Levins succinct and thought-provoking book makes its own contributions to our understanding of the Civil Wars place in the public consciousness.</p><p>Although focused on a single battle and its resonance over time, the book is far from narrow.  Topics addressed include: the emergence of the Lost Cause ideology; the battle between reformers and conservatives in Reconstruction Virginia; the growth of Veterans Organizations in the post-Civil War era; the cultural import of Civil War battle re-enactments; the creation of the Petersburg National Military Park; the post-World War II rise of family vacations to Civil War battlefields; the interaction between Civil War Centennial celebrations and the Civil Rights movement; and the contemporary debate surrounding the interpretation of the American Civil War.   His range of sources is similarly replete, including art works, films, old battlefield maps, programs from reunions and re-enactments, and numerous manuscript collections.</p><p>The battle of the Crater took place on July 30, 1864.  The engagement proved a disaster for the North and was one of the Souths notable victories in the last year of the conflict. It was also the site of a massacre of black troops. Union forces planned to dig a mine under Confederate forces, detonate an explosion, and then advance through the gap in the enemy lines to take Petersburg. After the shock of the initial blast, Union troops failed to push ahead with sufficient speed, fell into a deadly enfilading fire, and eventually succumbed to a counterattack by Virginia General William Mahone.</p><p>For the Confederacy, the use of black soldiers at the Crater marked an immoral escalation in the war. Southern soldiers wrote letters home to loved ones that described in grim detail the brutal vengeance they directed against African American troops, including the murder of non-resisting soldiers and prisoners of war.  A Mississippi Confederate wrote:  Most of the Negroes were killed after the battle.  Some was killed after they were taken to the rear (28). Blacks suffered 41% of the casualties even though accounting for only 21% of the Union combatants (19). Levin notes that for southern whites, black men in uniform marked a racial order turned upside down and constituted a direct threat to their own communities and families (29).</p> <p>In an irony of history, William Mahone, the Hero of the Crater, emerged in the postwar era as the creator of an inter-racial coalition that challenged white supremacy, black subordination, and an agrarian economy . . .   (68).  Mahone managed to control the state legislature from 1879-1883, and he pushed ahead with an ambitious program that readjusted the state debt downward in order to free up money for public schools.  His program cut taxes on the poor, ended the poll tax, and opened up patronage to black Virginians.  For state conservatives, Mahone posed a deadly threat to the existing political and social hierarchy because of his insider status and war hero credentials.  Levin offers a masterful account of the failed attempt by Jubal Early and other conservatives to swiftboat Mahone as a skulker, who didnt deserve credit for the victory at the Crater, and who had betrayed his old soldiers by reapportioning government jobs from deserving veterans to blacks.  Mahone survived the attacks in part because he had established close ties to his veterans, using reunions to build a political base.  When their old generals reputation was besmirched, his men rushed to his defense.  Even though it was displaced in 1883, Mahones machine remained a powerful force in the state throughout the rest of the 1880s.</p> <p>A recurring theme in Levins book is the interaction between hard financial realities and historic preservation.   Immediately following the war, the farmer who owned the land where the battle took place set up a small museum and a Crater Saloon charging a quarter per guest.  The battlefield became a site for veterans to meet and celebrate their participation in the Civil War and a stop for curious civilians eager to lay eyes on the big hole caused by the mine blast.  In 1903 a major re-enactment was staged with 20,000 observers and 50,000 spectators witnessed a sham version of the battle in 1937 (68, 101).  In 1918 the land at the Crater site was purchased by a group of investors who built a golf course on the site of much of the old battlefield.  With understated humor Levin notes the unconvincing efforts of the gold course president to reassure preservationists that green fairways and tees bearing the names of its [the Battle of the Craters] heroes were a beautiful shrine to the boys of the Blue and Gray who there made the supreme sacrifice  (100). In 1936, the federal government bought the land when the gold course closed and added it to the grounds of the already established Petersburg National Military Park.  Levin observes that financial pressures to keep the Parks largely white visitors happy with what they heard worked to keep controversial topics involving race out of the Parks narrative of the battle in its early years.</p><p>During the 1950s, planners for the Civil War Centennial intended to use the anniversary to celebrate the consensus view of the Civil War as a story about the common bonds of bravery and patriotism that animated both sides (113). However, the Civil Rights Movement intervened and made it impossible to ignore the role of race in the conflict.  In 1960, African Americans in Petersburg, engaged in civil disobedience to protest the citys whites only segregation laws in the public library (formerly the home of William Mahone.)  Levin notes that by 1964 a prominent public celebration of the Crater would have invited challenges to the way public memory of the battle had been used so effectively to reinforce white political control of the state (122). As a result, the Petersburg Civil War Centennial Commission kept commemorative celebrations to a bare minimum in order to protect the preferred interpretation (122).</p><p>From the 1970s onward Petersburg Battlefield Park sought to deepen its coverage of the part played by black soldiers at the Crater.  The Park added historical markers on the topic, hired more African American employees, reached out to the black community in Petersburg, and made clear to Park visitors the depth of Confederate bitterness toward the United States Colored Troops.   The new trend expressed greater comfort in showing multiple perspectives of historical actors in the battle and in owning up to the substantial divisions that existed within and between the combatants.</p><p>Levin does not conclude with Whiggish exultation that history will inevitably triumph over heritage.  He observes that in 2010, Virginia Governor Robert McDonnells reestablishment of Confederate heritage month aroused statewide and national outrage for failing to reference the role of slavery in the Civil War.  McDonnell beat a rapid retreat, apologizing for his omission. On the one hand, this about-face underscored the impossibility for a twenty-first century Virginia politician to elide the role of race in the wars origins. On the other hand, Levin suggests the desire to avoid making value judgments about the war seems to have continued.  In 2009 President Barack Obama turned down a petition to halt the sending of a wreath from the White House to the Confederate memorial in Arlington Cemetery.  As a compromise, he sent two wreaths, one to the Confederate Memorial and the other to the African American Civil War Memorial in the District of Columbia.   Levin points out the enduring power of an anodyne narrative of the Civil War that interprets our bloodiest war largely in terms of shared values.  He warns that such an approach not only distorts history, but also makes it impossible to have an honest discussion about racial questions in our own day.</p> <p><i>Francis MacDonnell is Professor of History at Southern Virginia University.

5346|978-0-8214-1977-9|$49.94 |Congress and the Crisis of the 1850s|\N|Finkelman, Paul (ed.)|Kennon, Donald R.|\N|<h3>Navigating Troubled Waters</h3><br><p>Pundits and journalists are often quick to despair of Americas legislative branch when they perceive that partisanship or deep-seated ideological differences stymie congressional efficiency.  Such alarmist assertions rest on the assumption that a golden age once existed in which Congress did not suffer from partisanship, intransigent opposition, and divisive issues.  Historians know better.  <i>Congress and the Crisis of the 1850s</i>, edited by Paul Finkelman and Donald R. Kennon, reveals that the 1850s congresses are only the leading examples of the partisanship, stalemate, and perhaps even dysfunction that have been historical constants for the United States Congress.  Yet, while underscoring these important continuities, this collection of essays also emphasizes that the haplessness of Congress in the 1850s derived primarily from slavery, a uniquely insoluble issue that exacerbated Congresss difficulties and ultimately led to war.</p>  <p>This volume revisits the familiar events of this busy decade, beginning with the Compromise of 1850 and moving forward through the disasters of the Buchanan administration.  The work draws together scholarship from different fields, and the interdisciplinary approach provides a variety of ways for thinking about the role of Congress.  Individual congressmen receive attention, as does public policy formulation, rhetoric, and partisan maneuvering.  The contributors also place Congress in its larger context, whether of economics, foreign policy, or political culture.  African Americans, for example, are present in Spencer R. Crews essay as political actors who engaged Congress.  Crew explores their efforts to frustrate one of the eras signature pieces of legislationthe Fugitive Slave Act.  African Americans radicalized white abolitionists and legitimized resistance, even violent, to this singularly obnoxious law.  The variety of scholarly approaches proves that there are still new ways of appreciating the part of Congress in the sectional crisis.</p> <p>Several of the essays wrestle with the Compromise of 1850 and its aftermath, and the treatment of this episode sets the tone of the work.  Finkelman discards the notion of compromise, labeling it the Appeasement of 1850.  According to his reappraisal, the slave states derived all the benefits from what was a fundamentally proslavery legislative package.  Michael F. Holt, in contrast, presents a nuanced view of the complex congressional negotiations behind the Compromise.  His detailed analysis suggests just how difficult it is to cast the legislative process in sectional terms, as each party split along sectional lines, yet each sections congressional delegation split along party lines (23).  The byzantine quarreling among factions over patronage and the hardly straightforward interplay between state party politics and federal policy belie any simple notion of the Compromise as a confrontation between proslavery and antislavery politicians.  Matthew Glassman similarly discusses the often acrimonious admission of new states as a complex process that entailed more than an effort to balance the number of free and slave states, further questioning the zero-sum game which Finkelmans use of the term appeasement implies.</p><p>Most of the essays follow Finkelmans lead in prioritizing disputes over slavery, especially fugitive slaves and territorial slavery, as the driving force behind the conflicts of the period, and, for this reason, Holts findings are an outlier in this collection.   Holt presents a settlement more akin to an actual compromise in which diverse interests came together and pushed through an elaborate package that could placate Whig and Democrat, North and South.  Finkelman rejects this idea and even goes beyond David M. Potters classic characterization of the Compromise as the Armistice of 1850 in <i>The Impending Crisis</i>.  An armistice is not a compromise, as neither side really cedes anything, but Finkelman sees one side giving up almost everything to the slave states.  Moving from armistice to appeasement might be too simple and seems to buy into the rhetoric of the Slave Power conspiracy theorists of antebellum politics.  The historiographical point, however, is clear: contrary to the claim that there were many issues troubling Congress, there was, with one minor exception, just a single issue: slavery (38).</p><p>Reappraising such exhaustively chronicled turning pointsthe Compromise, debates over the territorial expansion of slavery, the <i>Dred Scott</i> decision, the partisan realignment, and the caning of Charles Sumnerplaces a heavy burden of originality, whether in terms of analysis or sources, on historians of the 1850s.  Most of the essays clearly meet this challenge.  Holts contribution exemplifies his usual rigorous standards of argumentation and research.  Martin J. Hershock presents a compelling portrait of a little-known congressman, Kinsley S. Bingham, and recounts how his antislavery scruples led him from the Democratic to the new Republican party in 1854.  This pithy essay, one of the best in the volume, does more to convey the true meaning of the 1850s partisan realignment and the politics of sectionalism, by asking what the realignment meant for one man, than any rehashing of a more familiar event could.  Amy S. Greenberg, by attending to the gendered rhetoric of congressional debates over filibustering and territorial aggrandizement, reminds historians that what congressmen said actually matters.  Her detailed examination of congressional speeches proves that even seemingly traditional political history and its stalwart sources such as the <i>Congressional Globe</i> can yield riches, especially when open to new approaches.</p><p>Jenny Wahl offers a provocative thesis that the Panic of 1857 stemmed from the bursting of a speculative bubble in western lands and railroads when free-soil northerners no longer wanted to go west after <i>Dred Scott</i> opened federal territories to slavery.  While she marshals impressive economic data to demonstrate how the distinctively sectional dimensions of the financial crisis emboldened the South, she provides no evidence that northerners consciously made the calculation to forego western development due to slaverys potential spread.  Brooks D. Simpsons account of Bleeding Sumner is an approachable overview of an episode that has been hit upon by historians almost as much as the senator himself.  While his well-written retelling does not interpret the significance of the affair in a new way, it does allow the drama of the event to speak for itself.</p>  <p>This volume, overall, does not offer fundamentally new ways to think about Congress in the last antebellum decade.  Rather, it exemplifies leading historiographical trends and uses Congress as an arena for reiterating a crucial point that, although widely accepted, is still worth repeatingthat slavery was central to the politics of the 1850s and the coming of the Civil War.  Some essays, in their creative approach, bring new aspects of sectional politics to light and testify to the complicated and overlooked ways in which sectionalism and contention over slavery manifested themselves.  This collection illustrates that slavery defied legislative reckoning, whether from a dearth of congressional leadership, the intractability of the issue itself, or, as is most likely, a combination of the two.</p><p><i>Joshua A.

5347|978-0-8131-3444-4|$40.00 |The Union Forever: Lincoln, Grant, and the Civil War|\N|Simon, John Y.|LaFantasie, Glenn W. (ed.)|\N|<h3>A Prominent Historians Lifes Work Investigating Three Giants</h3><br><p>John Y. Simon was an exceptional scholar. As the founding editor of <i>The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant</i> in 1964, John presided over the project for forty years and thirty-one volumes, setting the gold standard for documentary history. The <i>Grant Papers</i> are clear, complete, and edited immaculately. They are essential for any serious student of the Civil War, and, thanks to Johns fine editorial hand, extremely easy to use. Professor Simons tragic death at the culmination of his lifes work has deprived the nation of its finest documentary historian and archivist.</p><p>In <i>The Union Forever</i>, Professor Glenn LaFantasie of Western Kentucky University has brought together fifteen of Johns finest essays. Seven deal with Lincoln, six with Grant, and two with Lincoln and Grant. Taken together, they provide the best and most concise distillation of the character of the two men who saved the Union. Simons treatment of Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation (Freeing Some and Leaving Others Alone) is a model of historical clarity; his essay on the relationship between Lincoln and General Henry W. Halleck (Lincoln and Old Brains Halleck) is priceless; and his reflection on Lincoln in the crisis year of 1864 (Lincolns Despair: The Crisis during the Summer of 1864) is must reading for those concerned with the presidents troubles.</p><p>But it is in the six essays on Grant where John is at his best. In his fifteen-page article From Galena to Appomattox (pages 153-167), Simon synthesizes Grants career with unparalleled precision. Having written about Grant myself, I can honestly say that I have never seen a better analysis. Similarly, in The Road to Appomattox Johns treatment of the 1864-65 campaign in northern Virginia is superb. Grant represented the calm at the heart of the storm of battle, quietly and carefully thinking through the problem without losing perspective, and he never lost sight of the ultimate goal of restoration of peace. The road that would take the nation to the end of the war in the shortest time with the smallest loss of life led through the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor.If Grants realism is not mistaken for callousness and his logic not mistaken for cruelty, then we can understand the commander who moved so relentlessly to Appomattox and, once there, began immediately a campaign for peace (188).</p><p>As befits an honest scholar, Simon does not gloss over what may have been the darkest shadow on Grants career, the infamous Orders No. 11 issued by Grant on December 17, 1862 expelling Jews from his department on the Mississippi (That Obnoxious Order). Washington intervened and Grant immediately revoked the decree. In 1868 he formally apologized. I do not pretend to sustain the order.The order was issued and sent without any reflection and without thinking of the Jews as a sect or race.It never would have been issued if it had not been telegraphed the moment it was penned and without reflection (177).</p><p>The two final essays on the complex relationship between Lincoln and Grant provide a perfect summation. Simon calls it an effective partnership in a turmoil of clashing authority (231)</p><p>Amid the confusion of war, Lincoln redefined the concept of commander in chief, Stanton transformed the concept of secretary of war, and Halleck created the concept of chief of staff. Charged with vast responsibilities, General in Chief Grant had to act vigorously within the military sphere, tread softly in the political sphere, and understand as well the politics of command. Under Lincolns guidance, sometimes oblique, sometimes imperious, Grant succeeded.</p><p>The Grant papers are now housed at the new Grant Presidential Library at Mississippi State University under the able direction of John Simons friend and colleague, John Marszalek. We are all poorer because of Johns untimely death, but I am certain John would be proud of how his work has been continued. <i>The Union Forever</i> is a fitting tribute to a man we loved and cherished.</p><p><i>Jean Edward Smith is the author of</i> Grant, FDR,<i> and most recently of</i> Eisenhower in War and Peace.<i> He is a senior scholar in the history department at Columbia.</i></p>|Smith, Jean Edward|Winter 2013|2/1/2013|Review|\N|\N|University Press of Kentucky|\N|Biographies;Military;Politics|\N|\N|"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=242 alt=\Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/TheUnionForever.jpg\"">"""|\N

Few books will be as fascinating and informative as <i>African American Faces of  the Civil War: An Album</i>. The third volume in a series about Civil War soldiers and seamen, <i>African American Faces</i> is a collection of previously unpublished identified photographs, accompanied by brief biographies, of seventy-seven men. With President Abraham Lincolns issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation on 1 January 1863 paving the way for their participation in the war that now would end slavery, over 200,000 black men enlisted and participated in the war. These profiles are representative of all types of men who served in the Civil War in multiple ways. </p><p>Using <i>cartes de visites</i>, ambrotypes, and tintypes that he discovered at the Beinecke Rare Bookand Manuscript Library at Yale University, in museums, in archives, and in private collections, and drawing information from military records, pension files, the United States Census, slaveschedules, regimental histories, correspondence, newspapers and family stories, Ronald Coddington reveals a remarkable portrait of the human side of the Civil War.  The profiles document the lives of men before, during, and after the Civil War.</p><p>A foreword by Civil War historian J. Matthew Gallman and a preface by the author introduce the reader to the technological developments in photography that marked the expansion of commercial photography, which coincided with the outbreak of the Civil War, and demonstrated the transition of the war from a conflict to save the Union to one of liberation. There is no mistaking the expressions of pride, self-respect, and consciousness of manhood on the faces of these brave African American soldiers.</p><p>The profiles open with Major Martin Delany, a familiar figure to scholars and general readers of Civil War literature. Other familiar figures profiled include seaman Robert Small, known as the Pilot, who captured the <i>Planter</i>, and Sergeant Major Lewis Douglass, son of abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Less familiar, perhaps, are Lieutenant James Monroe Trotter, father of political activist and editor of the <i>Boston Guardian</i>, William Monroe Trotter; William Henry Scott, a fourteen-year-old attendant to a Union officer, who became a founding member of W.E. B. DuBoiss Niagara Movement; as well as Sergeant Kendrick Allen and Private Solomon Starks who enlisted in the Ninth U.S. Calvary and became known as buffalo soldiers in Texas. </p><p>Probably unknown to scholars and general readers are Private Charles Mudd, who was one of five brothers who served in the United States Colored Troops, and Major Louis Snaer, whowas wounded in battle, saw duty at the Freedmens Bureau, and was elected to two termsas state representative on the Republican ticket in Louisiana during Reconstruction.Other soldiers profiles appearing in <i>African American Faces of the Civil War</i> includeMedal of Honor recipients Sergeant Major Christian Abraham Fleetwood, whose wife servedas a wartime nurse, Sergeant William Carney, Sergeant Milton Holland. Chaplain Jeremiah W. Asher is also featured. His grandfather served in the American Revolutionary War and fought at the battle of Bunker Hill.</p><p>The men whose profiles appear in the album represent more than a dozen units of the United States Colored Troops. They served in the Union army in infantry and artillery units and in the Union navy. These men proved themselves in battle, held garrison duty at forts, and guarded prisoners of war. They had various supporting roles in the war as cooks, attendants, musicians, drummer boys, and workers in the quartermaster department.  Most of them were ex-slaves from the South, especially the border slaveholding states. Other soldiers were free and came from northern states, from Iowa, and even from Canada, as was the case with Captain Anderson R. Abbott, a surgeon assigned to an 800-bed facility in Washington, D.C. that became known as the Freedmens Hospital. Some of these courageous soldiers did not survive the conflict, being fatally wounded in battle, dying of wounds received in battle, or succumbing to diseases like dysentery and meningitis. Other soldiers mustered out of the military and lived into their seventies, eighties and nineties.</p><p>Beyond documenting their military service, these profiles contain a wealth of information and offer a unique perspective of these men after the Civil War. Some veterans applied for and received pensions as a result of lingering and incapacitating wounds from the war. Most of the veterans returned to their wives and children or married and started families. They worked as day laborers, farmers, clergymen, educators, businessmen, barbers, janitors, firemen, and night watchmen. A particularly successful businessman in this group was former 1st Sergeant. Dandridge Meekins, who owned and operated a saloon, a restaurant, an ice dealership, and a coal and wood delivery service. Some men never married or outlived their wives and families and died in soldiers homes in Ohio and Illinois... A few entered politics and public service. While most the men featured in the album remained in the South, others returned to or moved to the North. Some men and their families moved west, becoming part of the group known as Exodusters.</p><p><i>African American Faces of the Civil War</i> closes with a profile of Private Charles Henry Arnum,who survived the war by more than fifty years. Arnum, a native of North Adams, Massachusetts, mustered into the 54th Massachusetts Infantry at age twenty and served in that regiment from 1863-1865. He participated in battles in South Carolina and Georgia. After mustering out in 1865, Arnum returned home to North Adams and became a trucker, hauling various goods. In 1872 he married. Arnum and his wife had a girl and a boy and he later started his own trucking business with his son, Harry.</p><p>On the evening of 7 August 1919, Arnum, then seventy-five years old, dressed in his blue uniform to serve as the guest of honor at a reception in North Adams held in honor of local soldiers and sailors returning from service in World War! Charles Henry Arnum died in 1934 at the age of ninety and was buried with full military honors.</p><p>Ronald S. Coddington is assistant managing editor of <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education.</i>He also is a passionate collector of <i>cartes de visites</i> and an excellent researcherand writer. He regularly contributes a column to <i>The Civil War News.</i> This third bookon soldiers in the Civil War, <i>African American Faces of the Civil War: An Album</i>, is a well-written, well-documented, and a valuable work.

5349|978-0-7006-1852-1|$39.99 |Corinth 1862: Siege, Battle, Occupation|\N|Smith, Timothy B.|\N|\N|<h3>Exploring an Under-investigated Campaign</h3><br><p>The town of Corinth, Mississippi owed its creation to the railroad.  Founded in 1854, it arose at a junction between two major railroads in Tishomingo County, Mississippi: the Memphis and Charleston and the Mobile and Ohio.  Completed in 1857 and 1861 respectively, the railroads literally brought life to the fledgling settlement.  However, with secession and the onset of the Civil War, the railroads also captivated Union and Confederate military planners.  Less than a year after workers completed the Mobile and Ohio, Union armies captured and occupied Corinth on May 30, 1862, denying Confederate forces this vital area after conducting a month long campaign.  Five months later, Confederate forces attempted to retake this junction, but were repulsed after two days of heavy fighting on October 3-4, 1862.</p><p>Despite its importance and the attention garnered as a railroad hub, the fighting for and occupation of Corinth in 1862 has yet to receive adequate treatment from historians.  Peter Cozzenss 1997 book <i>The Darkest Days of the War</i> examines the battles for Iuka and Corinth, while other books in recent years have briefly examined the October battle as well.  Timothy B. Smith, currently teaching at the University of Tennessee at Martin and the author of multiple books including <i>Mississippi in the Civil War: The Home Front</i> (2010) fills this hole in the literature through his newest contribution, <i>Corinth 1862: Siege, Battle, Occupation</i>.  Part of the Modern War Series from the University of Kansas Press, Smith examined both the military actions around Corinth in 1862 and how its inhabitants experienced these events and Union occupation.</p><p>Smith accomplished this by giving Corinths citizens equal attention within his narrative from the opening pages.  For example, Smith mentioned how the concentration of Confederate troops in Shiloh prior to the battle of Shiloh caused many of the women and children remaining in Corinth to leave (9).  After the bloodshed of Shiloh, Smith remarked how surgeons turned nearly every structure in Corinth into makeshift hospitals for wounded soldiers.  Placing Corinth front and center in his narrative allowed Smith to show how the townsfolk dealt with the arrival of both the railroads and the war to their doorsteps.   While many of Smiths chapters consider the siege of May 1862 and the October battle, he establishes a tone that guarantees a voice for the residents that remained in Corinth throughout the book.</p><p>Smith spent significant time assessing the siege conducted by Union Major General Henry Halleck in late April and May 1862 against Confederate forces commanded by Pierre G. T. Beauregard.  Smith remarked how topography, lack of good water, and the weather all played key factors in shaping how both sides acted during the siege.  The staggered start of Hallecks march on Corinth from April 27-29 reflected this, as the Union Army of the Mississippi had to traverse multiple creeks swollen from rain and would move slower than the Hallecks other forces, the Army of the Tennessee under George Thomas and the Army of the Ohio under Don Carlos Buell.  Smith highlighted how a fight between Pope and Confederate forces at Farmington on May 9 altered the strategic conduct of the siege.  From a Confederate perspective, he believed Beauregard did not allow enough time for Earn Van Dorn to bring his men into position for a flank attack that would have rolled up two brigades under Popes command, but Smith gave Van Dorn sufficient criticism as well.  Smith further illustrated how the battle altered Hallecks strategic outlook, as Farmington forced Halleck to adopt a much more conservative approach for the rest of the campaign.  Moreover, Smith insinuated that Halleck did not fully comprehend the impact of Farmington, arguing that he did not keep as close an eye on Pope as he should have after this engagement.  On the whole, Smith provided a balanced account on how the siege unfolded.  Ultimately, deteriorating conditions and supplies forced Beauregard to execute a complex but successful withdrawal from Corinth that preserved his forces from capture.  Despite Beauregards actions, the loss of Corinth as a railroad hub crippled the logistical capabilities for Confederates in the Mississippi Valley (102).</p><p>Smith gave more consideration towards Confederate Major General Earl Van Dorns attack on Corinth on October 3 and 4, 1862 against Union forces under the command of Major General William S. Rosecrans.  In depicting this two-day battle, Smith delved deep into the heavy fighting, showing how Confederate forces were able to push into Corinth itself by October 4 but were unable to hold the city.  Smith criticized both commanders for their mishandling of reserves on October 3, but reserved special scorn for Confederate division commander Major General Mansfield Lovell.  Lovell disregarded an order to attack on October 4 and did not move until after Confederate forces began their withdrawal.  Lovell, in Smiths opinion, cost the Confederates any possibility of victory through his inaction on October 4 (254).  Smith argued that Lovells inaction does not absolve Van Dorn completely of blame for the defeat, but that both individuals significantly contributed to this setback.</p><p>Despite all the attention Smith bestowed to these actions, the reader is constantly aware of how Corinths remaining inhabitants experienced the war.  After Corinths capture in May, Smith admits that little is known about the local government due to a lack of surviving town records, but utilizes what remaining accounts and surviving collections that he can in painting a vivid picture of how Corinth experienced the war and occupation.  As the battle for Corinth engulfed the town on October 4, 1862, Smith showed how some families took refuge in a dry well to avoid artillery fire from both sides (263).  These are but two examples of how Smith kept a proper perspective throughout, balancing social history with his extensive battle narrative.</p><p>In the final chapters Smith briefly touched upon Corinth in the final years of the war.  Included here are discussions concerning the recruitment of African-Americans, relations between the remaining civilians and soldiers stationed in Corinth, and the Union evacuation in January 1864.  In the epilogue, Smith traced the history of Corinths battlefields since 1865, bringing Corinth toward the present day.  Despite decades of neglect, recent legislation such as the Corinth Battlefield Preservation Act of 2000 and the creation of the Corinth Civil War Interpretive Center in 2004 have continued a turnaround begun in the 1990s to preserve these areas (306-7).  The epilogue brings forth Smiths interest in the history of Civil War battlefields and the ongoing efforts towards restoring Corinths image in the Civil War landscape, much like Smith's book itself.</p><p>Overall, Timothy Smiths <i>Corinth 1862</i> is a needed addition to the historiography of both Civil War Mississippi and the campaigns of the Western Theater.  His balanced approach ensured that the siege, battle, and occupation received proper attention throughout the work.  Smiths well-researched narrative should serve as the standard text on Corinth for the foreseeable future.</p><p><i>Charles Wexler is a doctoral candidate at Auburn University, where he is finishing his dissertation Palmetto Navy: The Charleston Squadron and the Naval Defense of Charleston in the Civil War, 1861-1865, under the direction of Dr. Kenneth Noe.</i></p>|Wexler, Charles|Winter 2013|2/1/2013|Review|\N|\N|University of Kansas Press|\N|Battles;Military|\N|\N|"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=242 alt=\Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/Corinth1862.jpg\"">"""|\N

In the first instance she has thrown fresh light on slavery and abolition, two much-studied topics. Secondly, she has produced a book that deserves considerable attention from professional scholars of those topics and at the same time will prove attractive to those whose interests in the subjects is more casual. The topic of art, abolition and slavery is rotationally vast, a topic that could easily spin out of control. McInnis makes it manageable by focusing first on the domestic slave trade in the United States and secondly on the work of Eyre Crowe, a little-known but talented English painter whose masterpiece provides the title for this volume.  Crowe visited the United States in the 1850s as an assistant to William Makepeace Thackeray. Thackerys lecture tour took them from Boston to Savannah, providing Crowe with many opportunities to view slavery and the slave trade. For Crowe, the most important stop was Richmond, a major hub of the slave trade. What he saw there inspired his best work. While McGinniss book is sharply focused, it also provides opportunities to comment on other visual representations of slavery and other types of artistic contributions to abolitionism, such as <i>Uncle Toms Cabin</i>. It also provides an opportunity for a detailed description of how the slave trade out of Richmond worked. My only disappointment is that she does not offer a systematic assessment of the role of visual culture in the effort to abolish slavery, although she does provide valuable material on which such an assessment might rest. Clearly, McInnis thinks visual culture made a vital contribution to the movement. At their best, these images proved to be a vitally important way to get a much wider audience to <i>see</i> slavery in new ways, and, for many, for the first time (10). This book is richly illustrated with examples of abolitionist painting. McInnis is an acute observer of art and her comments on the paintings provide a valuable introduction to how to look at paintings.</p> <p><i>Russell R, Menard recently retired from the History department at the University of Minnesota.

5351|978-0-674-06444-7|$24.95 |The Abolitionist Imagination|\N|Delbanco, Andrew|\N|\N|<h3>Imagining the End of Slavery</h3><br><p>To commemorate the 150th anniversary of the raid on Harpers Ferry led by John Brown in 1859, the <i>New York Times</i> in 2009 ran two op-eds that could not have been more different. One labeled Brown a martyr who should be pardoned posthumously. The other linked Brown to the 9/11 attacks and called him a fundamentalist and a terrorist. To literary historian Andrew Delbanco, these diametrically opposed views signal a deficiency in our approach to abolitionism. Seeing them as saints or as sinners gets us nowhere, he believes. Instead, in his now-published address before the Center for American Political Studies at Harvard University, Delbanco seeks to recast the abolitionists. He does this primarily by situating them vis-?-vis other white Americans of conscience from the nineteenth century who did not join them. Basically, Delbanco wants to know what was it about abolitionism that left thoughtful writers like Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne avoiding it.</p><p>Delbanco defines abolitionism as a recurrent American phenomenon where a determined minority endeavors to root out an entrenched evil (3). The odds against abolitionists are great; their moral fervor is great as well. They were, Delbanco exclaims, the thundering Isaiahs and Jeremiahs of their time (9).</p><p>Thoughtful writers like Melville and Hawthorne refused to align themselves with abolitionism, Delbanco continues, because they recognized the world as more complicated. They did not have the Manichean view of good-versus-evil that abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison held. Because of their ability to see human complexity and to avoid either-or moralities, Melville and Hawthorne then rose in prominence in Americas literary canon during the middle of the twentieth century when centrist positions became all the rage in response to Soviet Communism and the Cold War.</p><p>Responding to Delbanco, historians and cultural critics John Stauffer, Manisha Sinha, Darryl Pinckney, and Wilfred McClay critique and expand upon several points. Stauffer and Sinha emphasize the unwillingness of proslavery forces to compromise and how this compelled abolitionists into positions of immediatism. They also point out that proslavery forces were far more likely to turn to militant violence than abolitionists themselves. Pinckney channels the 1960s scholarship of Benjamin Quarles to narrate the place of African-American abolitionists in the crusade. And finally, McClay tries to understand how Delbanco renders abolitionism as a cultural symbol of America  complicated and fraught, but nonetheless raised out of human bodies and into a disembodied meaning all its own.</p><p>Overall, this is a strange book. For all the work that has presented abolitionism as a transnational movement, which will be best exemplified by Caleb McDaniels forthcoming book on the antislavery movement within transnational reform crusades, there is precious little in <i>The Abolitionist Imagination</i> that recognizes the world beyond the United States. Moreover, Delbancos initial essay is all over the map, supposedly about the abolitionist imagination, but then focusing on Melville and Hawthorne and the literary canon of the twentieth century. His effort to reimagine them as moralists who invoked the prophetic personalities and modes of biblical prophets has nothing particularly new to it. Then in his rebuttal to Stauffer, Sinha, Pinckney, and McClay, Delbanco clarifies his aims. I was left wondering why the clarity of the conclusion was nowhere present in the opening chapter.</p><p>Overall, <i>The Abolitonist Imagination</i> seems most beneficial for the ways Stauffer, Sinha, and Pinckney historicize the political, moral, and philosophical construction of abolitionism that Delbanco seeks to create. The responses show that in order to understand the moral convictions of any group at any time, we need to understand their context and surroundings. The white American abolitionist positions (and their imaginations) were created around the extremism, unwillingness to compromise, and unfreedoms created by southern proslavery advocates. To divorce them from that milieu seems to misunderstand them entirely. For these points, we can be grateful to Stauffer, Sinha, and Pinckney.</p><p>Edward J.

5352|978-0-306-82027-4|$26.00 |Terrible Swift Sword: The Life of General Philip H. Sheridan|\N|Wheelan, Joseph H.|\N|\N|<h3>New Biography of Prominent Union Leader</h3><br><p>Joseph Wheelans <i>Terrible Swift Sword</i> was a disappointing biography of General Philip Sheridan.  Wheelan is a former journalist who has written histories of Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams and the U.S. /Mexican War.  The danger for the non-specialist, without a deep background knowledge of the major events of the era and a tight research focus, is a book that has glaring errors.  For example, Wheelans portrayal of Grants Overland Campaign shows a serious misunderstanding of the war in Virginia.  Grants strategy is described as simple bloody attrition.  Moreover, Wheelans portrayal of the Indian Wars of the 1860s and 70s and Reconstruction politics is simplistic at best.</p><p><i>Terrible Swift Sword</i> offers a very unbalanced view of Sheridans life.  Although it is expected that his Civil War service should dominate a biography of Sheridan, other aspects of his life and career are barely covered.  As General of the Army, Sheridan made significant reforms that helped shaped the modern army.  Sheridan was instrumental in creating post-West Point education for officers and helped lay the groundwork for the armys modern staff system.  This is given very little attention by Wheelan who otherwise seems unfocused in his analysis of the general.  The coverage of the Plains Indian Wars, for example, is given the most attention in the book, second only to the Civil War.  Consequently, there were several times in reading that section that I had to remind myself that I was reading a biography of Sheridan and not George Armstrong Custer.</p><p>On the personal life of Phil Sheridan there is next to nothing.  We are told that Sheridan marries later in life.  We are told that he has three children with his young bride but there is not the type of personal information that one expects in a biography.</p>  <p>Wheelans research is by no means impressive.  It is obvious that Sheridans own memoirs were the main source and Wheelan rarely adds much to the narrative.  As any trained historian knows, personal memoirs should never be trusted in exclusion of other sources. He rarely if ever challenges Sheridans view of events.  In describing the 1868 Washita River Massacre, Wheelan agrees with the portrayal of events in Sheridans memoirs that the attack on Black Kettles camp was justified because Chief Black Kettle was responsible for numerous attacks on settlers.  The vast majority of historians of the Plains Indian Wars argue the exact opposite.  When Wheelan describes the Shenandoah Valley campaign it is obvious that he relied almost solely on Sheridans memoirs, the published memoirs of Confederate General John Brown Gordon and Jeffrey Werts <i>From Winchester to Cedar Creek</i>.  While these are very good sources, a professional historian has to go beyond memoirs and a secondary source if he is going to produce anything which adds to the field.</p> <p> On a positive note, Wheelans narrative of the Shenandoah campaign is very well written and his portrayal of Sheridan as a great general whose mere presence on the battlefield could bring victory is very compelling.  Wheelan should also be commended for the chapter on reconstruction.  He shows the violence and brutality that freedmen and Unionists faced that is often overlooked or downplayed in popular works. Yet unfortunately <i>Terrible Swift Sword</i> offers nothing new to Civil War historiography.  Wheelan has only synthesized works currently in publication adding countless mistakes of his own.  Even the title has been used so much as to border on becoming a clich?.  The reader would be much better served to read Sheridans own <i>Personal Memoirs, Werts From Winchester to Cedar Creek or</i> Paul Huttons masterful examination of Sheridan and the Indian Wars, <i>Phil Sheridan and his Army</i>.</p><p><i>Wesley Moody is Professor of History at Florida State College at Jacksonville.

Guy R.|\N|\N|"<h3> Prostheses for Amputated Limbs</h3><br><p>Guy Hasegawa is a well-respected historian of Civil War medicine and a practicing pharmacist.  He received his Pharm.D. from the University of California at San Francisco as well as advanced training at the University of Illinois at Urbana (the alma mater of this reviewer).  His well-written book is the only full-length treatment of artificial limbs in the Civil War.</p>  <p>The new armaments of the era took off arms and legs at an unprecedented rate.  \The minie ball striking a bone does not permit much debate about amputation,\"" said one experienced Union surgeon (Freemon, <i>Gangrene and Glory</i>, 48).  Earlier generations of amputees hobbled about on peg legs or made do with a hook for a missing hand.  But in the decades before 1860, artisans produced new artificial legs and arms.  Entrepreneurs, some of whom had themselves lost a leg, manufactured prostheses that resembled the missing limb.  Trial and error produced wood that did not warp, lining that did not produce an odor when wet, and legs with springs where joints had been.</p>  <p>War sometimes accelerates technological developments.  As the carnage of the American Civil War became apparent, Union medical authorities contracted with private firms to supply prostheses.  Surgeon general William Hammond summoned a board of Army and civilian surgeons to select the best available artificial limbs.  Despite some failings, the United States provided <i>gratis</i> the best available prostheses to its maimed soldiers.  The  Confederate medical authorities made no such effort.  A private organization in the South, supported by grants from cities and states and personal donations from individuals, took up the slack.  This organization was called ARMS, an acronym standing for Association for the Relief of Maimed Soldiers.   Fewer artisans in the South provided fewer limbs.  During the War, the Union provided 3,798 prosthetic legs and 2,204 prosthetic arms or hands.  The Confederate private organization provided 430 legs between January 1864, when they began in earnest, and March 1865, when Union forces overran the workshops.</p><p>History books end the Civil War in 1865, but for maimed soldiers, the misery of the war was just beginning.  The United States government supplied  artificial limbs to its veterans, including replacements every five years.  A limbless veteran could select payment rather than a replacement; most chose cash.  The United States government provided nothing for Confederate veterans.  After a few years, all former Confederate states provided prostheses for veterans from their states.</p>    <p>In the next hundred plus years, little changed.  Look at the limbs hanging from the ceiling of the prosthetic clinic in <i>The Fugitive</i>, a film released in 1993.  These artificial limbs had not visibly changed from those used by Civil War veterans.  Body armor used in the Iraq/Afghan Wars saved lives but did not protect limbs.  Research produced an entire new generation of prosthetic legs, allowing double amputees to run a faster 100 meter dash than most people with two normal legs.</p><p>This is a short book, only 80 pages of text.  Two appendices, 22 illustrations, and a detailed index swell the length to 126 pages.  In these few words, Hasegawa tells a compelling story.  The reader of his work alternates between sadness at the suffering of so many Americans and amazement at their courage.</p><p><i>Frank R.

5354|978-0-8203-4251-1|$24.95 |Ruin Nation: Destruction and the American Civil War|\N|Nelson, Megan Kate|\N|\N|<h3>New Approach to the Civil Wars Legacy</h3><p>No American in the spring of 1861, Northerner or Southerner, white or black, free or slave, could have imagined the scale and devastating longterm effects of the war that would soon engulf them.  If the sectional conflict generated a great deal of antebellum and early-war posturing expressing the fear of seeing ones homeland in ruins and at the mercy of a conquering foe, or the corresponding desire of reducing ones enemy to such ruins, those expressions were more rhetorical than real. It became clear soon enough, however, that the Civil War would create countless physical ruins accompanied by just as many psychic ones, both types more shocking in the moment and more persistent for years to come than anyone could have thought possible. Perhaps most disturbing of all, these ruins were made by Americans fighting themselves.</p>  <p>Hundreds of cities and towns, fields and forests, and houses, plantations, and farms would suffer as armies marched, cut, dug, fought, and plundered their way through the landscape, creating an almost ruin(ed) nation in the very process of determining whether it would survive as one nation or two.  Soldiers bore most of the human cost of that process, with many thousands dead and many thousands more wounded, some of them disfigured.</p><p>Participants and observers often referred to this process as <i>ruination</i>, and if that word seems quaint and colloquial to us now, its nineteenth-century definition as the fact or state of being ruined captures both the context and the spirit of Megan Kate Nelsons fresh and bold study.  Nelson, a lecturer in history and literature at Harvard, is the author of <i>Trembling Earth</i> (University of Georgia Press, 2009), a cultural history of the Okefenokee Swamp of south Georgia and north Florida. <i> Ruin Nation</i>, which considers how and why soldiers and civilians smashed things to pieces and then examines how they understood the debris, based on extensive and imaginative research in, and is a convincing interpretation of, wartime sources and relevant specialized studies in social history, cultural history, environmental history, and military history (9).</p><p>Nelson has identified four broad classifications of ruins made by the Civil War: urban ruins, of cities ruined by armies for various military and political reasons; domestic ruins, of homes, and especially private spaces and possessions within them, ruined by soldiers demonstrating their power over civilians; natural ruins, of forests, stands of trees, and even individual trees, ruined by armies building roads and camps or clashing in battle; and human ruins, of soldiers ruined by bullets or shells, dead or with limbs, organs, and nerves shattered or gone, and with their families often devastated as well.  She describes how and why such ruins were created, examines their immediate effects on divided Americans and their landscape, and employs wartime and postwar writings and photographs or engravings in popular weeklies to make ruination more tangible.  Nelson deftly gauges the impact the process had on Americans hearts and minds as well as on their popular culture, for years and even generations after 1865.  The ruins created by and ruination wrought by the war did not end when the shooting stopped.  A physical and psychological reconstruction, one in many ways more critical to the survival of the nation as a whole than political Reconstruction, was necessary but did not take place quickly or easily.</p><p>From the first few months of the war to its end, and for years afterward, the ruination of urban and domestic spaces inspired a debate over causes and responsibilities.  The argument over what was and what was not civilized warfare and who had lost any claim to waging it was especially vigorous over the ruination of private property.  For civilians unfortunate enough to be in ruined cities or landscapes, emotions already frayed by the destruction of business districts and public institutions were often torn apart by what they believed was a profanation of their homes and their very lives.  Nelson contends that confrontations between soldiers and civilians, especially Yankee soldiers and Rebel women, were as much acts of war as were artillery duels on the battlefield (78).  Because soldiers usually treated white and black, free and slave, all the same, they only emphasized civilians utter helplessness in the face of the soldiersand by extension their armys, and their governmentspower and will to do whatever they wished, for whatever reason.  Such behavior generated a bitterness among many victims that time did little to soften, as they passed down memories, stories, and mementos to their descendants and their descendants descendants. When a Federal soldier in South Carolina taunted civilians watching their capital burn, How do you like it, hey? that sort of insult was remembered almost as long and as vividly as the burning of Columbia itself (51).</p> <p>The armies that wrecked forests building roads or clearing spaces for camps viewed such work as accomplishing something worthwhile rather than destructive.  They also, however, destroyed countless stands of virgin or well-established timber constructing earthworks and digging trenches or erecting wooden obstructions to fortify themselves, then fought battles in which flying metal shredded or splintered leaves, limbs, and trees.  There was, even before the war ended, a fascination with forestsespecially individual trees with bullets or shell fragments visibly lodged in themas witnesses to history and relics of remembrance, and a feeling that as nature regenerated itself with new growth in forests and as grass grew up over the raw earth, the country might heal its own wounds with enough time.</p> <p>If cities, homes, and landscapes are clear examples of places that were once intact but reduced to ruins, Nelson points out that human beings who were once intact could also be reduced to ruins themselves.  As mini? balls whizzed through the air and shells exploded into hundreds of fragments, she observes, the wars technologies unmade men (161).  In no previous American war did the numbers of participants, or the combination by which largely outdated close-range tactics, more modern weapons, and woefully inadequate medicine killed or maimed them, cause so much suffering.  Nineteenth-century Americans were all too familiar with death, but not on such a scale or with results so spectacularly violent.  The sight of, or even the thought of, bodies without limbs and limbs without bodies, of men unrecognizable to friends and family or unrecognizable even as human beings, was something unfamiliar, shocking, and deeply disturbing.  Many of the wounded, so ruined that they viewed themselves, and were often viewed by others, as no longer men, might have wished they had died instead.  War promised to make both white and black soldiers into men, Nelson reminds us. However, wounds and amputations threatened the nature of that manhood in their assault on individual identity, humanity, and citizenship (185).  The ways in which veterans, their families, and their communities adjusted to, and gave or denied them praise and material aid for, such devastating personal losses, would be among the most significant responses to the human cost of the war for years to come.</p><p><i>Ruin Nation</i> is original, sophisticated, and persuasive, giving us a new lens through which we can focus our attention on significant aspects of the Civil War that we have never seen with such clarity.  It should be read, and reread, by anyone hoping to understand what the war did to America, as opposed to what it did <i>for</i> it; what <i>ruination</i> meant to those who lived through it; and how it influenced the ways in which Americans since have viewed the central moment in our history.</p><p><i>J.

5355|978-0-8078-3588-3|$35.00 |War on the Waters: The Union and Confederate Navies, 1861-1865|\N|McPherson, James M.|\N|\N|<h3>New Comprehensive Analysis of Civil War Naval History </h3><p>In August 1863, Abraham Lincoln wrote to his long-time friend James Conklin, summing up the US Navys all-encompassing role in the war effort.  While the president noted that the army had received most of the notable accolades, Lincoln penned Nor must Uncle Sam's web-feet be forgotten. At all the watery margins they have been present. Not only on the deep sea, the broad bay, and the rapid river, but also up the narrow muddy bayou, and wherever the ground was a little damp, they have been, and made their tracks.  Dr. James McPherson, professor emeritus of history at Princeton, and a Pulitzer and Lincoln Prize winning historian, reflects Lincolns sentiments.  He believes that the naval efforts have not received the attention they deserve and he assesses the roles of the Union and Confederate navies during the Civil War.</p><p>Organizationally, McPherson divides the naval war into five overlapping parts and he approaches the narrative in chronological fashion.  He maintains that the US Navy, in particular, deserves more credit for its wartime achievements and notes that the armies garnered the publics attention during the conflict and cornered most of the historical writing afterwards.  Due to this indifference, he contends that Rear Admiral David Glasgow Farragut should get the same recognition that generals William Tecumseh Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant each have received for their prosecution of the war.</p><p>The navy served as a pivot for the Unions war effortthe longer the war lasted, the more force the sea service brought to bear on the Confederacy and the more impact it had on the wars outcome.  The Union naval forces did score some significant victories for the Union cause without the armys assistanceCape Hatteras, Port Royal, New Orleans and Mobile Bay to mention a few.  The service also realized notable defeats such as at Charleston and Vicksburg.  McPherson relates in some detail the story of the Charleston campaign and the repulse of the ironclad fleet and the subsequent mired campaign to capture the cradle of secession.  This exemplifies well, the interservice rivalry and a lack of cooperation that cultivated a dysfunctional relationship and limited the successes of the military branches.  Illustrative as well are instances in 1862, when the army would not make available troops necessary to capture Vicksburg or the fortifications of Drewrys Bluff.  The navy was prepared to operate against these strong positions and would have required relatively few army resources to capture these points.  Despite the fact that victory was in the best interest of both military branches, the requests went unfulfilled.</p><p>McPherson relates how, for the navy, it was truly a worldwide conflict.  He weaves into the narrative information on the most important international issues.  The Confederacy had agents in Europe to buy war material and to build a fleet of commerce raiders, blockade runners, and warships.  The worlds seaways were also active with Confederate commerce raiders and the Union cruisers that chased them around the globe.  His account of the depredations of the raiders <i>Alabama</i> and the <i>Shenandoah</i> reveals the reason for the flight from the flag of American commercial vessels and the destruction of many more, including a large percentage of the US whaling fleet.  Also covered is the delicate issue of the blockade at Matamoros.</p> <p>McPherson also considers the leadership of both sides.  Farragut comes out well, but others such as Rear Admiral Samuel Francis DuPont did not.  The author gives both naval secretaries high marks for their work during the war.  He commends Gideon Welles for transforming the US Navy into one of the worlds most powerful forces afloat by wars end.  Stephen Mallory rates well for his use of innovation, technology and ingenuity to overcome the Unions preponderance of ships, men, and industrial capacity.  Chronicled are the use of submarines, mine warfare, ironclads and torpedo craft by the Confederates to diminish the advantages of the Union navy and to set back the Union cause.</p><p>The author only minimally discusses the blockade, the raison d'?tre for the navys entry into the conflict.  McPherson contends that the success of the Union blockade be measured by the goods and war material the warships stopped by its existence rather than how much commerce passed through the cordon of ships.  While relating that this was the primary task of the navy, the narrative never fully engages the reader with the scope and complexity of the blockade, the assets required to sustain the ships on station, and how all this affected the naval war effort.  The author saves for the conclusion a discussion of the blockades importance, but then in these final pages fails to balance this with the perspective of the navys incredibly important operational work with the army, something he discussed throughout most of the book.</p>  <p>The naval component was an integral part of the larger struggle and the ebb and flow of the war on the battlefields continually influenced the decisions made by the leaders of both navies.  The narrative would have been more complete if the author had better explained how the naval operations correlated to the overall war effort.  For example, we know from the text that Wilmington, North Carolina and Mobile, Alabama were both important naval targets early in the war.  Joint operations against these important blockade running ports, however, did not occur until late in the war.  McPherson never relates that the attacks languished until the army wanted to use these ports as potential bases for its operations.</p><p>McPhersons book is well researched and enjoyable to read.  His main reliance on primary sources helps flesh out the story with first-hand accounts.  The good illustrative maps throughout are extremely helpful.  His overarching goal was to show how the navies shaped the outcome of the war.  His argument that the Union navy gave the United States a great value, comparing its actual cost in men and budget, matched to the armys resources, is on point.  The Confederates on the other hand did the best with what they had.  Generally, McPherson feels that the US Navy did not win the war, but that the Union would have lost the war without its naval arm.  This is the best single volume available to acquire a cogent overview of the Civil War at sea, and the place for readers to begin their quest to learn about Abraham Lincolns webbed feet.</p><p></i>Robert M.

5356|978-0-7006-1868-2|$39.95 |The Failure of Popular Sovereignty: Slavery, Manifest Destiny, and the Radicalization of Southern Politics|\N|Childers, Christopher|\N|\N|<h3>Fresh Perspective on Popular Sovereignty</h3><br><p>Most historians know popular sovereignty as a political formula devised by Democrats of the 1850s to straddle the territorial dispute that threatened to split their party and the Union.  Instead of barring slavery in the West as demanded by supporters of the Wilmot Proviso, or echoing the Calhounite doctrine that slavery followed the flag, and must be legal throughout the national domain, popular sovereignty passed the choice between slavery and freedom from Congress to the territorial settlers themselves.  It obviously appealed to American traditions of local self-government, but it also relieved congressmen of the need to cast a pro- or anti-slavery vote that would inevitably alienate one section or the other, and hurt their partys chances at the next presidential election.  Long associated with doughfaces or northern men with southern principles like Michigans Lewis Cass or Illinoiss Stephen A. Douglas, popular sovereignty allowed Democrats to hang together as a bisectional coalition while the Whigs disintegrated and the nascent Republicans spoke only to a single section.</p><p>In this thoughtful and well-researched monograph, Christopher Childers shows that the concept of popular sovereignty as a solution to the slavery dilemma had a far older history than the 1850s.  While early lawmakers forthrightly banned slavery from the Northwest Territory, they allowed it in the territory south of the Ohio River by permitting its settlers to decide the matter themselves.  Later, the territory of Missouri successfully claimed the right of retaining slavery as it became a state.  In the famous Missouri Compromise, Congress effectively granted popular sovereignty over slavery in the southern portion of the Louisiana Purchase, including Missouri, while banning it to the north.  In other words, Congress settled the question by dividing the disputed territories between North and South, and used the substance, if not the label, of popular sovereignty as a mechanism for allowing the southern territories to choose slavery.</p><p>  For all the furor over Missouri, dividing the nations territory between slavery and freedom mostly kept the peace in the early republic and allowed Americans to preserve their fledgling Union while sidestepping its most divisive issue.  At the same time, popular sovereignty became an easy means for Congress to sanction the spread of slavery without saying so, banning bondage in northern territories and allowing a free choice in southern ones.  That began to change in the 1830s, when South Carolinas John C. Calhoun proclaimed the positive good of slavery and tried to persuade fellow southerners that barring it from any federal territory was both unconstitutional and demeaning.  At the same time, anti-slavery northerners began to resist the acquisition of Texas, reviving an argument from the Missouri Crisis that the end of slaverys expansion would eventually destroy it.   In other words, advocates for both sections began denouncing a division of the territories, each side becoming more interested in winning the slavery dispute than defusing it.</p><p>Following the Mexican War, these tendencies became ever stronger.  As Childers shows, popular sovereignty most appealed to two groups: Democrats who wanted to silence a controversy and activists who thought the policy would favor their own side.  The result was disastrous for sectional stability.  No matter how offensive to purists, splitting the territories had the advantage of clarity and finality.  Once a decision was made for both the trans-Appalachian West and the Louisiana Purchase, each section and each territory had known where it stood and where it would likely remain, discouraging further agitation.  By contrast, popular sovereignty created numerous points where sufficient pressure could force a slavery decision to be made, unmade, and remade.  Would the voters make their choice when Congress created a territory or when it became a state?  Who were the legitimate voters?  Who would prevent fraud and violence and count the votes?  Would the courts overturn a final decision?  The same questions would recur every time a new territory emerged, moreover, for a decision by one government would not bind the next one.  These questions became especially acute after the so-called Compromise of 1850, when for the first time, popular sovereignty in California brought anti-slavery results.</p><p> The inherent ambiguities of popular sovereignty made continual controversy inevitable, for much more was at stake than the labor system of an isolated locality.  Why should a random handful of territorial voters decide the balance between free and slave states, with all its momentous consequences?  No matter the result, the losing side was certain to challenge it.  Along the way, the doctrine only encouraged hypocrisy and double standards, as when southern extremists denied the right of Congress to pass any legislation at all about slavery in the territories, but demanded a federal slave code when they realized that free soil legislators could win their goal by simply refusing to adopt one themselves.</p><p>Perhaps anticipating this confusion, President Polk and a few others had hoped to deal with the Mexican Cession by extending the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific, but more committed sectionalists overruled them.  The result was an escalating political battle that moved inexorably from the so-called Compromise of 1850, to Bleeding Kansas, to the fraudulent Lecompton constitution, to demands for a federal slave code, to the rupture of the Democrats in 1860.  Each incident gave southern radicals a new opportunity to embarrass their moderate rivals with the politics of slavery, steadily raising the bar for what constituted pro-slavery orthodoxy.  In this atmosphere, those like Douglas who endorsed popular sovereignty to bring peace and please all sides ended up with just the opposite.</p><p>  Christopher Childers traces this progression with clarity and insight.  He is particularly astute in describing how Cass and Douglas struggled to preserve Democratic unity while their southern rights opponents fought just as hard to split and destroy both Jacksonian-era parties to create a solid southern bloc. In the end, Childers makes clear that territorial elections could not defuse the national crisis because the nature of the slavery dispute made the adversarys victory unendurable for either side.  Necessarily, perhaps, his account focusses exclusively on the white politicians who conceived the doctrine of popular sovereignty and fought its battles in Congress and party conventions.  This makes the narrative somewhat bloodless at times, as alert readers remember that none the arguments over territorial self-government would allow African Americans to govern themselves, or that real enslavement lurked behind the grandest phrases. If it is not clear how Childers might have remedied this condition in a monograph devoted to white southern leaders and their friends, he has plainly unpacked their history of popular sovereignty and the territorial crisis more thoroughly than any previous writer.</p><p><i>Harry Watson, Atlanta Alumni Distinguished Professor of History at the University of North Carolina, is the author of</i> Liberty and Power: The Politics of Jacksonian America.</p>|Watson, Harry|Winter 2013|2/1/2013|Review|\N|\N|University Press of Kansas|\N|Antebellum;Politics;Slavery;Social_History|\N|\N|"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=245 alt=\Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/TheFailureOfPopularSovereignty.jpg\"">"""|\N
5357|978-0-8139-3282-8|$40.00 |A Political Nation:  New Directions in Mid-Nineteenth-Century American Political History|\N|Gallagher, Gary W. (ed.)|Shelden, Rachel A. (ed.)|\N|<h3>Demonstrating the Importance of Political History</h3><br><p>This is a volume of essays treating American politics during the Civil War Era broadly defined, the 1840s to 1870s.  The collection was assembled by two editors.  One is a prolific senior scholar at the University of Virginia, Gary W. Gallagher, probably the leading historian of the Civil War at the present time.  His numerous works include <i>The Confederate War</i> (1997) and </i>The Union War</i> (2011).  Gallaghers collaborator is a promising young historian at Georgia College and State University, Rachel A. Shelden, who was trained at the University of Virginia.   The editors present the book as a tribute to the eminent historian of nineteenth-century American politics, Michael F. Holt, also of the University of Virginia.   Professor Holt has exemplied thoughout his career the highest standards in American political history, his most famous work being his monumental study of <i>The Rise and Fall of the Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the Onset of the Civil War</i>.   Gallaghers and Sheldens Festschrift is both a serious contribution to its field and an appropriate honor for their deserving colleague and mentor.</p><p> Once upon a time, history was commonly described as past politics.  In recent decades, however, the scope of historical research and writing has broadened greatly, particularly in the direction of social and cultural history.  Historians of all countries have been eager to recover the history of people excluded from political power, such as peasants, women, and members of oppressed minorities.   Their efforts contributed a sense of balance to historical accounts that had previously ignored the large portions of the population that did not participate in the political process.   Eventually, however,  some historians began to complain that the pendulum had swung too far.  Surely an understanding of the past required some sense of past politics, of the political leaders and their decisions.  Michael Holt not only practiced political history, he defended its relevance and importance. Among my fellow academic historians, he protested in 2004, American political history has become an object of scorn (<i>The Fate of Their Country</i>, p. xii).   Yet ordinary peoples lives were deeply influenced by the decisions of political leaders, in the past as in our own time, Holt insisted, and it makes no sense to leave politics out of history.  The editors of <i>A Political Nation</i> share Holts commitment to, and passion for, political history, but they express it here in a generally more upbeat way.  They take encouragement from the fact that the general reading public has retained a strong taste for the history of past politics and political decision-makers, even when academic historians have been pursuing other visions.   Still more, they take encouragement from showing how innovative political history can be, and how it can be enriched, rather than preempted, by the newer kinds of history.   The editors have assembled a truly impressive cast of contributors to their commendable enterprise.</p><p><i>A Political Nation</i> is divided into three sections.  The first consists of three articles on Political Culture in Antebellum America.  Rachel Shelden leads off with an article showing that Congressional opposition to Texas annexation was much more determined by party than section; Democrats supported it and Whigs opposed it.   Living arrangements reinforced partisan rather than sectional loyalties.  Few Congressmen brought their families to Washington; while in the capital they lived in boarding houses, typically with other Congressmen of their own party, by no means necessarily from their own section.   Mark Neely sustains his stellar reputation with an original story illustrating the prevalence of violence in antebellum partisan politics.   Jean Baker describes the several ways some women found to influence the course of antebellum politics even before the time of female suffrage.</p> <p>The second section, entitled The Politics of the Secession Crisis, presents three outstanding essays by three outstanding historians.  Daniel Crofts, building on his book <i>Reluctant Confederates</i>,  relates the fascinating story of the Upper South opponents to the Democratic Party, from their successful opposition to admitting Kansas as a slave state to their strong but ultimately unsuccessful opposition to secession.   William W. Freehling presents a subtle argument for Reviving State Rights as a cause of the Civil War.  Yes, he grants, the prevailing interpretation that black slavery caused the war correctly identifies a <i>necessary</i> cause, but by itself black slavery was not a <i>sufficient</i> cause of the Civil War as actually experienced.  True, the Deep South seceded to protect slavery from the likely future long-range threat represented by the election of a Republican President.   But the Middle South (as he calls Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas) only seceded to help protect the principle of state secession against the coercion of the Unionin other words, those Confederates fought for state rights rather than black slavery per se.   While I agree with Freehlings argument thus far, I would point out that it was already clear that there was going to be a war before the Middle South secededthe question posed for those and the Border States was Which side in the war will you be on?   In the third article of this section, William J. Cooper summarizes the reasons why Abraham Lincoln did not pursue a comprehensive compromise such as Henry Clay famously did in 1820-21, 1833, and 1850 and such as Clays successor John J. Crittenden proposed in 1861.   Cooper correctly identifies three reasons, but does not mention that Lincoln had not been unreservedly devoted to Henry Clay; as early as 1847 he had backed Zachary Taylor against Clay for the Whig presidential nomination.</p> <p>The third section of <i>A Political Nation</i> deals with issues of reunion.  Sean Nalty, a graduate student at UVA working with Professor Holt, leads off with an argument that the Union Party of 1864 was not merely a transparent short-term strategem to win Lincoln re-election, but represented (as Holt has earlier argued)  a serious long-term ambition to redefine the Republican Party as a nationwide, rather than a sectional, party.  J. Mills Thornton, in a fascinating quantitative analysis, shows how the Alabama state legislature elected under President Johnsons Reconstruction program shifted political power away from the planter elite toward the small farmers of the hill country.   Erik B. Alexander of the <i>Andrew Jackson Papers</i> project, another former Holt student, describes the moderate faction within the Democratic Party during the presidential campaign of 1868.  The moderates lost in their effort to make Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase the Democratic nominee that year, but came back to lead the party into its New Departure for the election of 1872.   In the concluding essay, Brooks D. Simpson argues that moralizing historians have been too harsh on the Grant Administration for failing to secure the civil rights of the freedpeople on a more secure basis.  In the context of the time, any imaginable alternatives to Grants policies would probably have been worse.  Simpson, a leading expert on Grant, finds it unclear that anyone could have done a better job than Grant, at least anyone who was electable (p. 227).   Simpsons assessment of Republican Reconstruction provides a fitting conclusion to a volume dedicated to a frank, unblushing recognition of political realities.</p><p>Closing the gap between popular and academic history could further revitalize public interest in our discipline, Gallagher and Shelden write in their introduction (p. 2). Amen!   A constructive step in this direction, as well as intrinsically valuable, would be more historical writing that includes both traditional subject matterpolitical, diplomatic, and military historyand the newer kinds of history that have excited so many recent academic historianssocial, cultural, and economic.  <i>A Political Nation</i> seems to herald a time when political history can resume its rightful place within a diverse and balanced conception of historical studies.</p><p>My admiration for <i>A Political Nation</i> should be clear.  But no book is perfect.  The list of works by Michael Holt on p. 231 omits <i>The Fate of Their Country:  Politicians, Slavery Extension, and the Coming of the Civil War</i> (Hill & Wang, 2004).</p><p><i>Daniel Walker Howe, professor emeritus at Oxford University and UCLA, is the author of</i> What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848.</p>|Howe, Daniel Walker|Winter 2013|2/1/2013|Review|\N|\N|University of Virginia Press|\N|Antebellum;Politics|\N|\N|"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=244 alt=\Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/APoliticalNation.jpg\"">"""|\N
5358|978-0-393-06531-2|$29.95 |Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865|\N|Oakes, James|\N|\N|<h3>Traversing the Intersection of Slavery and Constitutional Law</h3><p>James Oakes <i>Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865</i> will leave a lasting imprint on studies of the end of slavery in the United States.  Its clear argumentation and straightforward narrative style allows the book to bear its five hundred pages lightly. Oakes, a professor of history at the City University of New York Graduate Center and an author best known for his history of slaveholders, <i>The Ruling Race</i> (1982) and his prize-winning <i>The Radical and the Republican</i> (2008), gives us the clearest narrative history yet written about the policies ending slavery in the United States.</p>  <p>This narrative locates the origins of emancipation in the core of Republican policy, set in stone by 1860.  Republicans, building on antislavery thought and activism from the 1830s on, were firmly committed to making freedom national, implementing policies that assumed liberty to be a natural right enshrined by the U.S. constitution.  Republicans believed that by withdrawing all federal support for slaveryrepealing the Fugitive Slave act of 1850, abolishing slavery in the territories, on the high seas, and in the District of Columbia, forbidding it in U.S. military installations, and even regulating the interstate slave tradethey could erode the value of slaves in the U.S. and push southern states toward abolition.  If, Oakes argues, insurrections broke out in the South during this process of tightening federal controls on slavery, Republicans were committed to military intervention and with it, emancipation.  Everywhere the federal government and its agents would go, Republicans believed, they would carry freedom.</p><p>Once northern voters elected Abraham Lincoln to the presidency and his party to a majority in the House and Senate, slaverys days were numbered. Fire-eating secessionists were actually acting quite rationally, in this account, because the Republican legislative majority was determined to end slavery through ordinary, constitutionally ordained means and via extraordinary, military ones.  When war broke out, the ruling party was firmly committed to the end of slavery.</p><p>Republicans, in this narrative, presented a united front in their progressively ambitious attack on slavery, voting nearly unanimously to limit and then end the institution during the Civil War.  They pursued both constitutionally sound limits on federal support for slavery and aggressive military emancipation simultaneously from the beginning of the war, intensifying their assault on the peculiar institution as the war progressed and as slaverys intransigence and resilience became evident. By the first anniversary of Bull Run, the President and his allies in Congress were firmly committed to a policy of emancipation in all areas of the Confederacy and a policy of crippling slavery in the border states.  Republicans, Oakes convinces us, were no reluctant emancipators.  <i>Freedom National</i> supplies a very different narrative than the ones we are accustomed to reading and telling.  There is no important ideological change over the course of the war, no movement from a war about restoring the Union to a war for the end of slavery. It was always a war to end slaveryall the talk about war 'purpose' may have been technically true but was also cover for an attack all Republicans intended to be the fatal blow against slavery.</p> <p>Oakes is at his best when closely analyzing the texts of official edicts, teasing out the nuanced difference between bills as they moved through committees and the subtle meanings of military proclamations as commanders implemented them across the South.  These close readings allow him to argue that there was no shift in Republican consensus from a war for Union to a war for emancipation.  The publicly stated purpose of the war was always to restore the Union, but Republicans had always also seen the war as an opportunity to implement policies they hoped would end human bondage in the United States.  Oakes supplies creative glosses of episodes that seem to cut against such an interpretation, glosses that will strike many readers as novel and perhaps controversial.  The Corwin amendment to the constitution, which if passed would have forever prohibited federal interference in slavery in the states, was superfluous in this telling, because it did nothing to stop the principle of freedom national and gave no additional support to slavery.  Its prohibition was against the active abolition of slavery in the states, an act that Republicans already believed unconstitutional.  Their plans for ending slavery would strangle it without recourse to such blunt means.  Thus the substantial Republican vote for the Corwin amendment said nothing about their commitment to destroying slavery in the American South.  Oakes argues that Abraham Lincoln was spouting nonsense during the Second Inaugural address, when he stated that neither the North nor South anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease since, according to Oakes, he intended to destroy slavery in the war and, with his allies in Congress, had the means to do so.  The presidents claim not to have controlled events was a famously misleading bit of mythmaking (338).  Republicans had the end of slavery in mind all along and were firmly in control of the process.  When put together, interpretations such as these make for a remarkably coherent account of the end of slavery, one that may make the process and Republicans intentions seem more coherent than they actually were.</p><p>The clarity resulting from a tight focus on the antislavery goals of Republicans comes at the price of potentially undervaluing the roles other actors played in what Oakes, following Frederick Douglass, calls the great movement to end slavery. Though he forswears any interest in well-worn debates over agency in emancipation, Oakes narrative decisively shifts the focus of emancipation studies from the fields of the South to the halls of Congress.  While <i>Freedom National</i> lauds self-emancipationin which enslaved men and women ran to Union lines at the earliest opportunityas an important development in the end of slavery, it was less a surprising, pivotal act that redirected the meaning of the war than it was part of a scenario Republican congressmen had already imagined and incorporated into their program for the wartime destruction of slavery.</p>  <p>The field is undoubtedly better for the insights found in <i>Freedom National</i>.   If, in its focus on the Republican Partys antislavery agenda, the book obscures the multiple roots of emancipation and the multiple, competing agendas of Republican lawmakers, these are flaws in a most useful, exciting new book. No other text so clearly explains the policies that abolished racial slavery in the United States.</p>  <p><i>Scott Nesbit is the Associate Director of the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond and a Ph.D. candidate in History at the University of Virginia.

Over the past 138 years, Mary Lincolns insanity has been studied closely and written about extensively.  Her case has been examined from feminist, legal, and medical angles.  It has been scrutinized from speculations on Robert Lincolns motives in 1875 for having his mother legally committed as insane to the Bellevue Place Sanitarium in Batavia, IL.  Another view emerged with Jason Emersons recently published <i>The Madness of Mary Lincoln </i>(Southern Illinois University Press) while this volume scrupulously provides source material to enable readers to form their own opinions.</p><p>From the time she was committed against her will in May 1875 until her freedom four months later on August 24, Mary lived in a single room prisonlike structure.  When she was released, the <i>Chicago Times </i>declared Her physicians pronounce her as sane (126).  She had been given an hours advance notice before her trial on May 19, 1875.  The testimony of hotel staff, shop clerks, and four doctors who had never examined her, was admitted into evidence.  A jury declared her insane and her son Robert was made her guardian, responsible for her estateincluding her substantial financial assets.</p><p>Or was Robert driven by darker motives?  What caused Robert to have his mother humiliated and committed?  He claimed genuine concern for her well-being, alarmed at her bizarre behavior and statements.  She had told him that someone was trying to poison her and that a spirit was removing bones from her face, while he asserted that his mother has been irresponsible for the past ten years  (x).  Mary claimed he was interested in her wealth and possessions as she was heir to a third of her husbands estate while Roberts own financial needs far exceeded his earning power.  Moreover, biographer Jean Baker believes Robert feared that his mothers strange behavior might ruin his political career.</p><p>Marys rescue from the Bellevue asylum was accomplished by the legal team of James and Myra Bradwell.  Its a drama within the family drama between mother and son.  Myras clandestine visits to Mary at Bellevue provoked more press coverage and a second trial in which Mary was declared restored to reason, and fully capable of managing her own assets (183).  Mary left the United States after her release from the asylum and moved to Europe for four years.</p><p>Jason Emerson is a Lincoln family specialist with excellent detective skills.  Other historians have been equally fascinated with the Lincoln family history (e.g., see <i>The Insanity File: The Case of Mary Todd Lincoln </i>edited by Mark E. Neely, Jr. and R. Gerald McMurtry about the 1875 jury trial declaring Mary Lincoln insane as well as the role of her eldest son Robert, and the authors excellent <i>Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T. Lincoln</i>, Southern Illinois University Press).</p><p>After her husbands assassination, convention dictated that Mary Lincoln should live quietly, but social norms seldom ruled her life.  Her reputation was undermined from her obsession to buy many of the same items and not use them.  After Robert filed a petition to have her declared insane and committed, he then became the star witness at her hearing.  Mary was declared insane and ordered to the sanitarium.</p><p>This documentary evidence contains startling details of Marys story before, during and after her trial leading to her eventual release from the sanitarium, as well as the damaging effects of Roberts breach with his mother.  Drawing on primary sources, Jason Emerson presents a detailed portrait of a woman who remained her own person.  The more than 100 letters, many newspaper articlesincluding editorials, and legal documents, become almost bewildering.  Emerson includes daily patient progress reports from the sanitarium where Mary Lincoln was confined.  He also provides reminiscences, interviews and diary entries from people who knew her or were involved in the case, including one of the jurors in the 1875 trial.  The author is correct when he says, This collection is a documentary history of Mary Lincolns mental illness and insanity case, and is a compilation of every possible primary source on the subject (xiii).</p><p>Mary Lincoln emerges as a special woman with problems.  For Jason Emersons own opinions and interpretations, readers should look to his <i>The Madness of Mary Lincoln</i> (Southern Illinois University Press).  This volume gives readers easy access to the documents supporting his opinions.  Many may be surprised to learn that Emersons interpretations differ from Marys most recent sympathetic biographersJean H. Baker (<i>Mary Todd Lincoln: A Biography</i>) and Catherine Clinton (<i>Mrs. Lincoln: A Life</i>)who both believe that Mary was forced into an asylum by evil doctors and a heartless son (xv).<p><p>While some of these documents have appeared before, e.g., in Emersons <i>The Madness of Mary Lincoln</i>, and Mark E. Neely, Jr. and R. Gerald McMurtrys <i>The Insanity File: The Case of Mary Todd Lincoln</i>, this collection is more extensive and allows readers the opportunity to make more informed judgments.</p><p>Today, Mary Todd Lincoln remains more of an enigma than a reality, even as new evidence emerged in the form of a trove of letters long thought to have been destroyed (see <i>The Dark Days of Abraham Lincolns Widow as Revealed by Her Own Letters</i>, Southern Illinois University Press, also by Jason Emerson).  Nevertheless, her strength and intelligence cannot be discounted.</p><p>Mary left the United States after her release from the asylum.  Based in Pau, France, she lived and traveled in Europe for four years.</p><p>Always ranking near the bottom of the first-lady polls, even below Frances Harding, it seems Mary Lincoln deserves better.  She had great passion and a good mind, troubled as they may have been at times.  As for Robert, it may be sad justice that he also was institutionalized for depression in 1922.  Dysfunctional families and the relationships between mothers and sons have always been a part of human history and they continue to be to this day.  Leo Tolstoi said it best, . . .every unhappy family is unhappy in its own fashion. (Anna Karenina, Part I, ch. 1).</p><p><i>Frank J.

5360|\N|\N|CIVIL WAR TREASURES: <br>I Hope You Will Learn to be a True Patriot: A Southern Planters Letters to His Son at Harvard|\N|Taylor, Michael|\N|\N|<p>When John Walworth dropped off his seventeen-year-old son Douglas at Harvard College shortly before the beginning of fall term 1850, the students and faculty there had just endured one of the most scandalous events in the schools history. John White Webster, a professor of chemistry and geology, had recently been convicted of the gruesome murder of fellow professor George Parkman, a member of one of Bostons wealthiest families. To try to cover up the crime, Webster had dismembered the body and thrown parts of it into the furnace and toilet in his private laboratory. Parkmans torso, too big to burn, was found locked in a chest, half of a charred leg shoved up inside of it. A horrified judge and jury wasted no time in sentencing Webster to death. </p><p>John Walworth was on his way home to Natchez, Mississippi, when he heard news that Dr. Webster had gone to the gallows<sup>1</sup>. As terrible as the professors actions were, however, they must have seemed like only the most extreme example of how the nation was becoming more and more uncivilNorth pitted against South, white against black. Although that year saw the Compromise of 1850, the national rift continued to widen, and little more than a decade would pass before the whole country became embroiled in a four-year killing spree arguably no less heinous than the Webster-Parkman murder case. Even after the slaughter came to an end, another madman, John Wilkes Booth, would choose to settle his grievances with a pistol rather than civilized debate. Perhaps sensing this alarming trend toward violence, Walworth emphasized in one of his first letters to his son after leaving him at Harvarda letter now part of the LSU Libraries Special Collectionsthat he should study ease of manners and a kind and conciliatory deportment as well as your books <sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Admittedly, it was a challenging time for southerners like the Walworths to be civil to their Northern neighbors. Abolitionists, after all, were jeopardizing their very livelihood. A New Yorker by birth, John Walworth had joined the ranks of prosperous Mississippi planters, owning, by the 1850s, about 200 slaves and two plantations totaling more than 3,000 acres, plus some 1,400 acres of wild land in Arkansas <sup>3</sup>. Although he disliked abolitionists, he felt strongly that he owed his prosperity to the Union and scoffed at the idea of secession, which, to his dismay, his son Douglas was in favor of. Harvard, in fact, was part of his plan to teach Douglas something about patriotism. If the boy got nothing more out of his time there than a lesson in good citizenship and getting along with other people, his father believed, he would be the better for it.</p><p>Disunion ought not to be thought of, Douglas was advised in another letter. The South had gained much in the Compromise of 1850, which included the passing of the Fugitive Slave Act. Daniel Webster, the first man of all New England, was still doing all in his power to allay sectional differences, and when we have all the great and good on our side, we may look with contempt and listen in silence to such petty politicians as raise these little neighborhood meetings. Therefore never allow yourself to get warm or in the least excited on this subject. I would not talk on it, but refer such (as wish to make themselves conspicuous by broaching it) to the Constitution of the United States and say, that is all we ask, and if they violate it, they are covenant breakers; and with such you wish to have nothing to do <sup>4</sup>.</p><p>Covenant breakers on the other side of the aisle, however, were just as bad, in Walworths opinion, and the legislature back at home in Mississippi was rife with them. Led by the states fire-eating governor and fellow New York transplant John Quitman, the ultras, Walworth believed, shared the blame with rabid fanatical abolitionists for the worsening sectional crisis. This clique is equally contemptible in numbers and not much better generally in character <sup>5</sup>. Walworth was also suspicious of filibustering schemesattempts to take over Latin American countries and create a Southern, slaveholding empireand he discouraged his son from getting involved in them. When, in 1851, Narciso L?pezs failed invasion of Cuba ended in the execution, by the Spanish, of his Southern cohorts, Walworth showed little sympathy, calling the men deluded and the whole affair a wild quixotic expedition <sup>6</sup>.</p><p>I hope you will learn to be a true patriot, to know no South, no North, but my country and my whole country, Walworth wrote to his son on yet another occasion, quoting the Great Compromiser, Henry Clay <sup>7</sup>. He believed Northerners ought to follow the same advice. While part of his reason for sending Douglas to New England for an education was to form acquaintances and friendships at school which will be lasting and to learn to respect different points of view, few Northerners, he found, were returning the gesture. [T]he Northern youth knows nothing of the South and her institutions, nor of her wants <sup>8</sup>.</p><p>In the end, of course, Walworths best hopes for further compromise came to nothing. Douglass education, too, did not turn out as expected. Despite having shown promise as a student, the young man was more interested in girls, clothes, the theater, and trips to New York and Philadelphia. A combination of ill health and homesickness compelled him to drop out of Harvard after his first year. He transferred to Princeton, but felt even less at home there and soon returned to Natchez. By the time he signed his name to the roll of a Confederate infantry regiment, his fathers good advice to him as a teenager must have seemed a thing of the past. When the people of the North and South know each other and their duties to each other better, his father had written a decade before, we shall have more quiet times and better feelings <sup>9</sup>. We are left to wonder whether Douglas, during his years at war, ever reflected on the wisdom of those words, now that he was encountering his former schoolmates once again, not in the classroom, but on the battlefield.</p><p>The Walworth Papers are one of several collections in the LSU Libraries Special Collections containing materials related to Southerners at Northern universities in the mid nineteenth century.

5361|\N|\N|CIVIL WAR SESQUICENTENNIAL: <br>The Election(s) of 1860|\N|Miller, Randall|\N|\N|<p>By all accounts, the election of 1860 was what political scientists would later term a critical election--that is, an election that reflected and/or affected a significant shift in party alignments and/or brought about a significant shift in policies that reflected and/or affected political behavior thereafter, at least for a generation. Without benefit of political scientists methodology or terminology, the American people in 1860 understood that the election was critical and that they needed to stand up to be counted. Indeed, scholars have estimated that more than 81 percent of the eligible voters cast ballots in 1860, making it the second highest percentage turnout in American history. But what had the voters decided in 1860? That question beggared contemporaries and nagged scholars thereafter.</p><p>The most critical question about the election was not who won, but whether those who had lost would accept the result. And this, more than examinations of the election itself, has been the focus of new work on the meaning of 1860. </p><p>Many studies going back to Allen Nevins and continuing to recent publications have noted how threats of disunion coming from southern fire-eaters in the late 1850s into the 1860 election cycle disrupted ordinary political processes and then fractured the Democratic Party, leading to the Republican electoral victory. By some accounts, especially those focusing on southern honor that result almost demanded that southerners honor their threats that any Republican gain would mean secession, lest they lose face at home and credibility in history. Whether out of a crisis of fear after John Browns raid and northern triumph at the polls and/or anger and frustration at their diminishing political prospects in Washington, white southerners gave the day to the secessionists in the other elections of 1860namely, those choosing delegates to the secession conventions in the deep South. In doing so, they in effect decided that they owed no loyalty to an electoral process that had sustained the republic since the first contested elections of Washingtons and Jeffersons day. They set about electing a new government in forming a Confederate States of America and urging other states to join them. All this is almost consensus among historians, though they sometimes differ over the details and daily dynamics of the secession process.</p><p>Scholars essaying the election also note two vital facts that undermined defeated southerners willingness to accept Lincolns authority as president-elect or even the legitimacy of his election. One fact was that Lincolns election owed entirely to northern votes. Boding ill for acceptance of any Republican victory in the national election was the refusal of deep southern states even to have Republican electors on a ballot. Not surprisingly, Lincoln did not win a single slave state or even a majority in any congressional district in one. A second and related problem was that Lincoln won with less than 40 percent of the popular vote, and with not so much as one vote in many southern districts. As a minority president who gained the Electoral College victory on a regional vote, Lincoln hardly had a political claim to southern acceptance of his victory. He did have a constitutional one, which secessionists refused to respect. But it would be fears of a supposedly antislavery president and party more than the circumstances of Lincolns election that caused secessionists to win their own elections to take their states out of the Union before Lincoln could be inaugurated and do any damage to their interests. Again, on that subject, scholars generally agree. </p><p>Less agreement comes when considering Lincolns actions as president-elect to secure his election. The initiative came from seceding southern states that did not even wait on Lincolns inauguration to reject the results of the election. As president-elect, Lincoln sought to arrest the process of secession by giving reassurances to the South that his administration posed no direct threat to slavery and southern interests. On December 22, 1860, he wrote as much in a private letter to his erstwhile friend and former Whig colleague Alexander Stephens of Georgia that Do the people of the South really entertain the fears that a Republican administration would, directly or indirectly, interfere with their slaves, or with them, about their slaves? If they do, I wish to assure you, as once a friend, and still, I hope not an enemy, that there is no cause for such fears. The South would be in no more danger in this respect, than it was in the days of Washington. The letter was somewhat disingenuous for Lincoln surely knew that Republicans in power would try to confine slavery and otherwise limit its growth and power, as was their principal reason-for-being and the expectation of those northerners who had voted for them in 1860. But it was also an honest effort to convince supposedly non-radical southerners to let the political process play out normally and thereby to buy time for unionism to reassert itself. Doing so would give the nation a chance to accept the result of the election rather than coming apart over it. Whether Lincoln bet too much on supposed southern unionists rallying to reverse the secession tide is an issue much debated among scholars. Just so in considering the extent to which Lincoln actually believed his words and actionsreally non-actionswould work. </p><p>As efforts to bring the seceded states back into the Union failed during the secession winter and as a crisis loomed at Fort Sumter, Lincoln was sworn in as president and Republicans took their seats in a Congress that, with members of the seceded states now gone, gave them a party majority. How they managed such a transition to power is the subject of some debate among historians, though surprisingly little recent work has examined that process and its implications for translating an electoral victory into Republican policy. Seemingly, though, the Republicans had won the election.</p.<p>But, to judge by recent work on Lincoln taking office, Lincoln knew he had to make a case for the necessity of recognizing and respecting the result of the election in a way that did not emphasize Republican triumph. In his March 4, 1861, inaugural address he sought again to allay southern fears about Republican intentions by insisting that they would respect the Constitution and make no aggressive moves against the South, while also declaring the illegality and impracticality of secession and promising that the Union would defend its fundamental interest in self-preservation.  More important, he explained why it was necessary for southerners to accept the result of the election when he observed that Plainly, the central idea of secession, is the essence of anarchy. Once begun, it can have no end, and the great experiment in self-government that God anointed and history required would collapse. The election of 1860 thus was about the validity, credibility, and sustainability of the electoral process itself.</p><p>Circumstances and events ended any prospect of secessionists honoring the election result. The seceded states had no interest in returning to a Union that they believed fundamentally had rejected their interests in protecting slavery, and the necessity of legitimating their own new government soon drove them to seize federal property and then to attack Fort Sumter. And the war came.</p><p>For contemporaries and many historians, the ordeal by fire that came in 1861 defined the meaning of the election(s) of 1860. Many historians have focused on the causes and consequences of southern fears about an impending crisis over slavery and explained the election(s) in terms of southern preoccupations more than northern concerns. Also, many studies have taken the long view of the election, examining, for example, the rise and fall of the second American party system, the emergence of a distinctly (and increasingly abrasive) sectional politics in the 1850s, and the simultaneous groundswell of anti-partyism among fire-eating southerners and antislavery northerners that made political compromise anathema. Such studies showed the structural failures in an American party system designed to keep the divisive slavery issue out of public discourse and electoral considerations and a culture of politics that thrived on pugnacious electioneering, conspiracy theories, and personality over principle.</p><p>Although scholars have disagreed on any inevitability about the crack-up as occurred in 1860-1861 or about the extent to which non-party or anti-party radicals disrupted the political system to the point where it was incapable of righting itself amid a decade of sectional rancor, those scholars generally have framed discussion of the election(s) of 1860 in dialectics, with the initiatives principally coming from southern demands for slaverys expansion and protection and the reactions from northerners increasingly adamant to assert their own free soil and other interests by the late 1840s (David Goldfield in<i> America Aflame </i>almost alone places the onus on a northern evangelical moralism starting and impelling distrust and disunion). Doing so has made understanding southern fears seemingly more important than northern ones. And it has left the focus on the election(s) of 1860 largely a matter of explaining how the war came rather than how contemporaries understood and acted on their interests in those elections. It also has discounted the importance of intraparty differences and internal struggles within the states, especially northern ones, in explaining the successes of particular Republicans and Democrats at the polls and southern secession afterward. </p><p>To be sure, scholars such as Eric Foner, William Gienapp, Tyler Anbinder, and others re-oriented the focus on politics toward considerations of northern political identities and interests. They did so by showing that northerners pushed their own initiatives in trying to contain a slave power and defined themselves in terms of the free soil principles that created and held together a Republican party in the 1850s and even informed northern Democratic politics at the same time. In their telling, the North-South dialectic derived its energy from northern as much as southern imperatives and impulses. And the stakes were so high that the people turned out to vote for their interest in record numbers. Such interest carried with it ever greater expectations that the men who sought their votes would act on them, with manly courage and without hesitation or equivocation. They expected elections to bring results. This was as true for northerners as for southerners. </p><p>What is needed now is a fuller exploration of those northern interests and imperatives. Recent work by Adam Goodheart, Harold Holzer, Douglas Egerton, and especially Russell McClintock has emphasized the energy and anger of northerners, who organized as Wide-Awakes and other political clubs to press for Republican victory and then to demand that Republicans make no concessions to southerners refusing to respect that victory. Scholars remind us that the election of 1860 was in fact many electionsthe presidential one conducted in the South between a split Democratic party, with Stephen A. Douglas and John C. Breckinridge pitted against one another, the one in the border states where the Union party sought to keep a peace by beating Republicans and Democrats of all stripes, and the one in the northern states between the Douglas Democrats and the Republicans. We know much about those particular contests, but what is not so well understood is how the elections worked out, on the ground, in the northern states and how the expectations coming from the many state and local elections defined and directed what people demanded of winner and loser alike. It was not only southerners who viewed the election as a test of union and honor. </p><p>Thinking about the election(s) of 1860 in more local terms will help make sense of its national significance and will enlarge the scope of inquiry to give northern ideas and interests equal consideration in explaining how and why the consequences of the election(s) of 1860 proved so difficult to contain within traditional political categories. It also will take the focus of the election(s) of 1860 from preoccupations with political elites to examinations of the people on the ground. Doing so will provide the kind of peoples history for the politics of the day that will help make sense of what people wanted and expected the election to realize, whether on the winning or losing side.</p><p><i>Randall Miller is Professor of History at Saint Josephs University, has written on various aspects of slavery, the Civil War, and Reconstruction.

Congratulations Dr. Oakes and thank you for joining us today.</p><p><b>James Oakes (JO):</b>  Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here.</p><p><i><b>CWBR: </i></b>   You review in your book the drive of Republicans to make freedom national since the 1830s.  How did the Republican Party find such a level of freedom in the Constitution when the Democrats did not?</p><p><b>JO:</b>  Well, that's a long and complicated question.  They went back to the records of the Constitutional Convention and to the records of the founding era and discovered to their own satisfaction.  They were satisfied to discover that the founders had left an anti-slavery legacy that was more powerful than most contemporary historians actually believe was there and also that one wing of the anti-slavery movement, the Garisonian wing, belief was there specifically they saw in the language of the Constitution the repeated reference to slaves as persons rather than property and from that they deduced that the Constitution did not recognize slaves as property from the anti-slavery rulings of English courts that were extremely influential in revolutionary America.  They deduced that slavery could only be created by statutory or positive laws they called it and that in the absence of such statutory the universal presumption of the natural law was freedom since slavery was strictly a state institution.  It could not exist anywhere outside the boundaries of a state that had slave codes on its books and created slavery by positive law this would have been true in all of the northern states.  But, it was also true in all of the western territories and any areas where the Constitution itself was sovereign. There was positive law recognizing the existence of slavery again that meant not only the northern states that had abolished slavery but also the high seas, Washington D.C., the western territories.  And, if properly followed that constitutional logic would lead to a series of policies that would as you put it and I put it in my book make freedom national and slavery merely local, a state institution, on the assumption that slavery was a weak and inefficient and backwards institution.  The republicans, or antislavery people, assumed that once these policies were implemented the slave South was surrounded, not allowed to expand, no more new slave states, abolished in Washington D.C., suppressed on the high seas.  All those things, once you do that, you surround the South with what they called according to freedom.  Slavery would die of its own accord a natural death so the logical outcome of the policies associated with the doctrine of freedom national was that slavery would ultimately be extinguished.  Thats the language Lincoln used all the time.  We wanted to put slavery on a course of ultimate extinction.</p><p><i><b>CWBR: </i></b>   Based on this plan do you believe that slavery could have ended as many Republicans seemed to hope, without war?</p><p><b>JO:</b>  I don't know.  That's a hypothetical question and I've gone back and forth with it.  I guess if I had to come down again, it's a hypothetical question, its a counterfactual.  I dont know, and nobody really knows, but Ive gone back and forth about this with some friends who disagree.  If pushed I would say I don't think it would work.  I think they underestimated slavery's strength.  I think they underestimated slaverys economic vitality and, also Im not sure that how long it would have taken for the Republicans anti-slavery party to gain enough congressional strength to be able to implement that kind of policy to its fullest.  So, it requires too many assumptions about the potential power of the Republicans in the national power of the anti-slavery northern party and of slaverys intrinsic weakness and its likelihood that it would die.  But, that said, its almost impossible to find a Republican who doesnt believe that slavery will be put to death if these policies are implemented you get different estimates.  Thaddeus Stevens said do this, implement these policies, and it will be gone in 25 years.  Secessionist during the secession crisis said if we let the Republicans implement these policies slavery will be dead in 10 years.  When Lincoln proposed these policies for the Border States, the policies of gradual abolition, his preferred time table was 10 years.  But, Owen Lovejoy the anti-slavery Congressman, the abolitionist Congressman, from Illinois, said at one point during a speech in the 1850s, look well give you 25 years if you do this, just start it now and if it takes 25 years thats fine.  In fact if it takes 50 years thats fine.  So Republicans did uniformly believe that if you implemented these policies slavery would eventually die. But, I dont know if I really can say that I doubt that that would have happened, and I doubt that that would have happened based on not so much on my ability to see the counterfactual but because of what I saw happen in the Civil War.  That is slavery did not die even under 4 years of intense overwhelming military bombardment by the north, and a concerted campaign of military emancipation alongside the policy of building according to freedom.  Even with that I believe slavery would have survived the Civil War and I believe thats the position most Republicans eventually came to by the end of the war.</p><p><i><b>CWBR: </i></b>   During the war you show that Republicans still work within Constitutional limit when working to end slavery, especially in the Border States, how important was the reaction of slave holders in the Border States to Republicans emancipation plans?</p><p><b>JO:</b>  Well, the Republicans had two distinct emancipation plans.  The Border State plan is often mistaken as the primary plan.  So, that we get a certain positive trajectory that says the Republicans began by advocating gradual compensated emancipation and ended up by advocating universal uncompensated military emancipation.  In fact, military emancipation was a distinct policy, and it was applied to the disloyal seceded states almost as soon as the war began and the other policy of pressuring the loyal slave states to abolish slavery was applied subsequently because it was a peace time policy.  It couldnt begin to be implemented until Congress came into session for the first time during the war, full regular session, beginning in December 61.  So, almost immediately at the moment Republicans hit the ground in December 1861, they began noticing the Border States were resisting.  That there was a problem with the Border States and within a few months time they had comes to the conclusion that there was far less unionism in the Border States than they had believed.  There would be and that they were going to have to pursue a much more aggressive policy to force those states to abolish slavery on their own.  So, the reaction of the Border States accentuated and accelerated the aggressiveness of the Republican policy with regard to the loyal slave states.  But, it did not impede the development of the universal emancipation of military emancipation in the succeeded states.  What changed over time was the relationship that Republicans understood between those two policies, that is going into the war, Republicans, all Republicans, all antislavery people, for decades had assumed that slavery was weak.  Weak everywhere.  Weakest in the Border States.  That the Border States would be the first to abolish slavery and once it was abolished there it would seep further and further into the South as the intrinsic weaknesses of the system became more and more evident.  The shrinking power of each new Free State, Border State transformed into a free state, further weakens the power of the slave states as a block, and they believed that it would start in the upper South and then move to the lower South.  But, by the spring of 1862, they begin to reverse that premise.  Having implemented a policy of military emancipation in the seceded states they began to say to the Border States you know you better start abolishing slavery quickly.  Because if you dont, military emancipation will seep northward into the loyal Border States and slavery will be disintegrated by, as Lincoln put, it the mere friction and abrasion of war.  So, I dont accept the standard interpretation that says Lincolns concern for the Border States inhibited his acceptance of emancipation.  He, in fact, had accepted military emancipation long before, months before, he made his first proposal for gradual compensated abolition in the border states and, if anything, the war accelerated and made more aggressive the approach to the Border States that would have been there in a naturally peace time situation.</p><p><i><b>CWBR: </i></b>   You show a Republican Party bent on ending slavery, but how widespread were these ideas among the general northern population?  Does Lincolns re-election show that they understood and supported emancipation as much as Congressional Republicans did and did the average American understand the Constitutional issues involved?</p><p><b>JO:</b>  I think more qualified historians than myself have amply demonstrated that in this period of American history all issues, all major political issues, all sources of political division whether it be the Bank of the United States, the internal improvements, or slavery were framed in constitutional terms.  It was simply normal for Northerners and Southerners alike to frame all their arguments about slavery in constitutional terms and, it was universally insisted upon among republicans that they would never over step the bounds of the constitution by having the Federal government abolish slavery directly in the state where it was already legal.  That was simply understood across the board.  Its almost impossible to find anyone in the United States in 1860 who believed that the Constitution allowed the Federal government to abolish slavery in a state where it already exists.  So that is simply the consensus of pro-slavery and anti-slavery people, Democrats and Republicans.  So all debate over slavery takes place within that consensus about the Constitution.  So I would have to say after that long winded answer that the short answer to your question is yes, Northerners did understand the constitutional limits within which the debate over slavery took place.</p><p><i><b>CWBR: </i></b>   Can you explain how the impending end of the war impacted Republican plans, were Republicans really as nervous about slavery returning in a post war United States that did not have a Constitutional amendment that ended the institution?</p><p><b>JO:</b>  Yes, this was a surprising discovery for me.  I actually began this book inspired by an event that was central to my last book which was the second meeting of Frederick Douglas and Abraham Lincoln that took place in August of 1864 when Lincoln looked he was going to lose his bid for reelection and he called Frederick Douglas to the White House for a second meeting and said to him looks like Im going to lose and slavery is not yet dead.  We need your help to organize a cadre of blacks who can move unnoticed through the South to inform as many slaves as possible that they are freed because once I lose and go out of office the Emancipation Proclamation process will end and Douglas did not dispute that and I remember when I first started thinking about that discussion between the two of them I said well if thats correct and Lincoln historians who say Lincoln freed all the slaves with a stroke of his pen by affixing his signature to the Emancipation Proclamation have got it wrong.  That Lincoln himself did not believe he had done that and that side who claim that the slaves freed themselves, that slavery was deteriorating, and that no force on earth could have stopped the revolution from completing itself, they must have been wrong also if these two guys very smart guys meeting in August of 1864 in the closing year of the war are agreed that slavery wasnt dead and would survive the war if Lincoln and the Republicans were not re-elected.  Then I was going to have to investigate that and see what was going on there and when I did I discovered that in the book Ive just finished, I discovered that this was actually a widespread assumption among Republicans.  That by late 1863 after the two anti-slavery policies had been implemented completely and fully the pressure on the Border States, the loyal slave states, to abolish slavery on their own.  All those policies had been implemented to put the pressure on them and not a single one of them had abolished slavery and military emancipation had been enforced at high tide beginning with the Emancipation Proclamation.  Universal emancipation had been decreed, a whole cadre of emancipation agents had been sent through the South to entice slaves off their plantations.  Blacks had been admitted into the Union Army by the tens of thousands and yet it looked like the North, the tide of the war, had changed with Gettysburg and Vicksburg in the summer of 1863.  It looked like the tide had changed in favor of the North.  The North was going to win the war but it also looked like by the end of the year again when republicans came back to Congress it looked as though the war would end with a northern victory but without slavery having been abolished and over the course of the next several months from December of 1863 to about March of 1864 Republicans debated among themselves what was the best way to get slavery thoroughly abolished and since all the various legislative proposals looked as though they ran up against the Constitution the only solution they could agree on was to re-write the Constitution.  In March, in the spring of 1864, the Senate endorses the 13th Amendment.  In June, the Republican Party endorses the 13th amendment in its platform and the House rejects it.  The Democratic minority defeats it in the House and the Republicans go into the 1864 elections committed to that 13th Amendment thoroughly abolishing slavery everywhere.  The other fear that I didnt see in my last book but came pouring out of the sources when I went through them this time was not only that most of the slaves would not actually have been physically freed by the war.  The war would end with most of them still slaves but, also, the threat that once the war was over the Constitution would be restored, slavery would once again revert to the control of the states and the states would be free not only to perpetuate slavery but to re-enslave those who had ostensibly been freed by the war.  This was a threat that was openly made by slave state representatives from the loyal slave states on the floor of Congress and virtually every speech made by every Republican in defense of the 13th Amendment said this will do two distinct things, it will end slavery everywhere in the United States and it will make the possibility of it being revived impossible so the fear of re-enslavement ,the re-establishment of slavery after a northern victory was a crucial aspect of Republican motivations in pushing for the 13th Amendment.</p><p><i><b>CWBR: </i></b>   Why do you believe that most people today do not seem much in the way of emancipation taking place before the Emancipation Proclamation, is it they myths that have grown up around Lincoln or have historians not gotten the narrative correct?</p><p><b>JO: </b> Thats a tough question and the answer I give ultimately has to do with politics.  That is, we should probably explain that one of the things I try to demonstrate in my book is that in the very earliest months of the war when Congress came into a special session five months ahead of schedule, in July of 1861, Republicans began emancipating slaves and that there was an emancipation clause in the First Confiscation Act and the orders for implementing that law were issued by the War Department on August 8th, 1861.  From that date on you see emancipation spreading with the Union Army as it moved down into occupied areas of the Confederacy along the southern Atlantic coast and then in 1862 up the Mississippi Valley in Louisiana and ultimately up all the way into Tennessee and the areas occupied by Sherman and Grants armies.  So that by the time the proclamation is issued, tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands have already been emancipated under the various policies implemented beginning in the summer of 1861 and yet even as even before the Emancipation Proclamation was issued all of that emancipating was obscured by the nature of the debate over slavery.  I think the best answer I can give to why people in this secession crisis were saying disunion means abolition, and we are going to abolish slavery.  All republicans are saying this despite the fact that they have been in charge of the abolition process in the Sea Islands in the late 1861 and in Louisiana in 1862.  Despite that most republicans, began to say it was inconceivable to me that we would ever reach the point where we would emancipate all the slaves with the Emancipation Proclamation.  I think the explanation for that has to do with the fact that in 1862 when they are implementing a universal policy of universal emancipation in the seceded states is an election year and the Democrats begin to say, look we said all along that this was the goal of this party, that this was an abolitionist party, not a unionist party.  They dont really care about establishing, their primary goal is not restoring the union, the primary goal is abolitionizing the whole United States.  Republicans respond by saying it was inconceivable to us that we would ever reach this point.  This is entirely the product of unforeseen circumstances in the war and exactly the same thing repeats itself in the 1864 presidential elections when right after the Republicans have committed themselves to a 13th Amendment and once again Democrats begin to say, and say all through the election, you see this is what we told you were going to have, a war without end until the Republicans successfully destroy slavery.  This is what they wanted all along and once again Republicans start saying no this was inconceivable to us we never imagined.  Thats when you start hearing Lincoln say it was unimaginable to me that we would ever get to this point where we would be abolishing slavery.  Everybody knew the war was caused by slavery but nobody could have imagined that the results were so fundamental and astounding.  Well, in fact, everybody had imagined it but in the context of the political between northern Democrats and Republicans the Republicans are put in the position of having to deny the charge that they had been going after slavery all along.  That was their primary motivation and in the process obscuring the fact that they have been going after slavery all along starting in the early years of the war.  Thats the best explanation I can have for the peculiar disappearance of all those emancipations in the first years of the war from the historical memory.  It would take someone whos better equipped to study historical memory than I am to give a fuller answer.</p><p><i><b>CWBR: </i></b>   Professor Oakes, I appreciate you taking the time to sit and discuss your most recent work, <i>Freedom National: The Destruction of slavery in the United States, 1861-1865</i>.</p><p><b>JO:</b>  Thank you very much.</p>"""|Frawley, Michael|Winter 2013|2/1/2013|Interview|\N|\N|W.

5363|\N|\N|EDITORIAL: <br>The Guard Always Changes but the Quality Remains the Same|\N|Buman, Nathan|\N|\N|<p>Since the smoke cleared from battlefields across the United States and the guns of the Civil Wars combatants fell silent Americans began their timeless endeavor to understand what they had endured.  This (now 150-year-old) struggle to understand the complexity of the war and its causes guarantees that, as the generations pass, we will always remain in good hands.  Civil War scholarship has evolved constantly since the war and continues to do so in fascinating and insightful ways, hinting that continued research and interest in this topic will continue to yield ripe fruit.  The Winter 2013 issue of <i>Civil War Book Review </i>will be my last as editor of this fine publication but the conversation will continue and well-qualified hands will lend their guidance in the issues to come.  Michael Frawley, who conducted the interview in this issue will take over as editor and I do not doubt that he will prove more than capable of this task.  </p><p>In this the Winter issue, we feature several books that provide nuanced ways of examining the Civil War and this cutting edge scholarship helps to guide the next generation to a better understanding of its past.  Christopher Childers, a former editor of <i>Civil War Book Review </i>himself, has written an excellent work that examines the concept of popular sovereignty and the ways in which it challenged Americans prior to the Civil War as they sought to combat the mounting sectional crisis.  <i>The Failure of Popular Sovereignty: Slavery, Manifest Destiny, and the Radicalization of Southern Politics </i>will undoubtedly prove a useful text for many years to come.  Gary W. Gallagher and Rachael A. Shelden have compiled and edited a vital collection of essays that explore other political questions.  <i>A Political Nation: New Directions in Mid-Nineteenth-Century American Political History </i>proves the continued viability of political history and its contents will appeal to a varied range of scholars.  James M. McPherson has provided a comprehensive analysis of naval operations during the Civil War in <i>War on the Waters: The Union & Confederate Navies, 1861-1865</i>.  McPhersons contribution will surely stand tall for many years to come and contribute a great deal to the conversation about naval warfare.  Megan Kate Nelson breaks new ground in <i>Ruin Nation: Destruction and the American Civil War</i>.  In this study, Nelson digs deeper to provide an understanding of what the war did</i> to</i> people and their environment, blending Civil War studies with environmental history in a very helpful way.  </p><p>James Oakes graciously granted <i>Civil War Book Review</i> an interview and our new editor, Michael Frawley, conducted this interview.  Frawley and Oakes discussed his new Gilder Lehrman Lincoln Prize-winning <i>Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865 </i>which explores Republican Party policy toward slavery both before and during the four years of conflict.</p><p>  We have several other excellent features this quarter as well.  Michael Taylor highlights a collection of letters that shows the intimate relationship between a southerner and his family as the war loomed.  Randall Miller wrote a very useful essay for our sesquicentennial column that examines the complex ascendency of Abraham Lincoln in the presidential election of 1860.  Finally, Frank Williams looks at a recent documentary history of Mary Lincolns insanity trial in order to better understand one of the least-favored first ladies in American history.</p><p>As always, and for the last time, I must remind our readers that this scholarly journal would not happen if not for the excellent support staff, including our editorial assistant David Blankenship (who will also leave his post this spring), our fantastic library and special collections staff who help us, and the readers, reviewers, and publishers who continue to work with <i>Civil War Book Review </i>and make this a worthwhile venture.  </p.|\N|Winter 2013|2/1/2013|Editorial|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N|\N|"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=200 height=334 alt=\Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/winter13cover/EditorialWinter2013.jpg\"">"""|\N
