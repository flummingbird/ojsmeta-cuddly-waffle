The files `native*` are packaged with the OJS application under `plugins/importexport/articlesandissues/` (path is approx.).
As there filenames imply, `native.dtd` is the DTD of the import/export format expected by OJS, and `native-sample.xml` is a sample document conforming (assumedly) to that DTD.
